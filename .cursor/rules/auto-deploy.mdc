# Auto-Deploy After Task Completion

This is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. Deploying is low risk.

## Rule

After completing any task that changes site content or build output:

1. Run the build: `cd hfn-build-system && python build.py`
2. Stage all changes: `git add .`
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Push to main: `git push origin main`
5. GitHub Actions deploys `hfn-site-output/` to GitHub Pages automatically

## Why

- Static HTML — no server, no database, no runtime errors
- GitHub Pages deployment is atomic and instant-rollback
- Pushing to `main` triggers the deploy via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Don't wait for permission. Just build, commit, push, and verify.

## After Deploying

- Verify the site loads at the production URL
- Log the deployment to `~/.memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
