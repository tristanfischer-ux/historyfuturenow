# Auto-Deploy After Task Completion

This is a static website hosted on Vercel. Deploying is low risk.

## Rule

After completing any task that changes site content or build output:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh "feat: description of changes"
```

This single command: builds the site, commits, pushes to git, deploys to Vercel production, verifies the site, and logs the deployment.

### Manual steps (if not using the script):

1. Run the build: `cd hfn-build-system && python build.py`
2. Stage all changes: `git add .`
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Push to main: `git push origin main`
5. Deploy to Vercel: `cd hfn-site-output && vercel --prod --yes`

## Important

- The domain `www.historyfuturenow.com` is served by **Vercel**, not GitHub Pages
- `git push` alone does NOT deploy to the live site — you MUST run `vercel --prod`
- The deploy script handles both git push and Vercel deploy

## Why

- Static HTML — no server, no database, no runtime errors
- Vercel deployment is atomic and instant-rollback
- Don't wait for permission. Just build, commit, push, deploy, and verify.

## After Deploying

- Verify the site loads at https://www.historyfuturenow.com
- The deploy script auto-logs to `~/.memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
