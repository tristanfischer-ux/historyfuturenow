# Chart Fact-Checking Protocol

Every data point in every chart MUST be verifiable against a named, published source. Charts are arguments made visible — if the data is wrong, the argument is wrong, and the publication's credibility is damaged.

## Before Adding Any Chart Data

For EVERY numerical value in a chart definition:

1. **Search for the actual figure** from the cited source (or the most authoritative source for that data)
2. **Record the exact value** from the source, not a rounded or estimated version
3. **Compare** your chart value against the source value
4. **If it differs by more than 5%**, stop and fix it before proceeding

## Common Errors to Prevent

| Error | Example | How to Prevent |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Stock vs flow confusion** | Showing cumulative FDI stock as "annual FDI" | Always check whether a figure is a total (stock) or per-year (flow). Label accordingly. |
| **Fabricated absolute values** | Showing 68% when Gallup says 40% | Never extrapolate or estimate. Use the actual published number. |
| **Stale data labelled as current** | Using 2023 trade data but labelling it "2024" | Always check what year the data actually covers. Match the label to the data year. |
| **Metric conflation** | Using "% of degrees awarded to women" as "% of women with degrees" | These are different metrics. Ensure the chart label exactly describes what the data measures. |
| **Reporter vs partner asymmetry** | EU reports €355B trade; African side reports $240B | Choose one consistent data source. Note which perspective is used. |
| **Wrong comparator framing** | Annotation says "A overtakes B" when the chart's own data shows otherwise | Always check annotations against the chart's own data points. |
| **Adults vs minors conflation** | Using poll data about adults to label a bar about minors | Read the exact survey question. Match the chart label to the question asked. |

## Required Source Verification Checklist

Before any chart is committed, verify:

- [ ] Every data point matches a published source to within 5%
- [ ] The chart title accurately describes the data shown
- [ ] The y-axis label exactly matches the metric being plotted
- [ ] The source citation names specific publications, not vague attributions
- [ ] Time periods in titles/labels match the actual data years
- [ ] Annotations are mathematically consistent with the plotted data
- [ ] Units are correct and consistent (millions vs billions, % vs absolute, stock vs flow)
- [ ] Where data is from a specific revision (e.g. UN WPP 2024 vs 2022), the revision is stated
- [ ] The article text and the chart data are consistent with each other

## When You Cannot Find an Exact Source

If a data point cannot be verified against a published source:

1. **Do not invent a plausible number.** This is how fabricated data enters charts.
2. **Flag it** with a comment: `# UNVERIFIED: [data point] — needs source`
3. **Use the closest verifiable figure** and adjust the label to reflect what you actually have
4. **Never round aggressively** — if the source says 15.6, use 15.6, not 14.5

## Preferred Authoritative Sources

| Domain | Primary Source | Secondary Source |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Population | UN World Population Prospects (latest revision) | Worldometers, Our World in Data |
| Trade | UNCTAD; national trade ministries | World Bank WITS |
| FDI | UNCTAD World Investment Report; CARI (for China-Africa) | fDi Markets |
| Education | OECD Education at a Glance | UNESCO Institute for Statistics |
| Political attitudes | Gallup; Pew Research | European Social Survey; national polls |
| Energy | IEA; Ember; IAEA PRIS | BP Statistical Review |
| Economics | World Bank; IMF WEO | OECD Economic Outlook |

## When Reviewing Charts

If any chart data point cannot be traced to a named source within 60 seconds of searching, flag the chart as requiring fact-checking before it can ship.
