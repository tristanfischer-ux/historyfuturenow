# British English Throughout

This is a British publication. All content must use British English spelling and a British narrative voice.

## Spelling

- **-ise** not -ize (organise, realise, specialise)
- **-our** not -or (colour, labour, honour, favour)
- **-tre** not -ter (centre, theatre, metre)
- **-ence** not -ense (defence, licence, offence)
- **-lled/-lling** not -led/-ling (travelled, modelling, cancelled)
- **grey** not gray, **tyre** not tire, **aluminium** not aluminum
- **programme** not program (except computer program)

## Voice

- British understatement over American hyperbole
- "rather" over "really", "quite" over "very"
- Measured, authoritative tone — The Economist, not The New York Times
- Dry wit is welcome; breathless enthusiasm is not
