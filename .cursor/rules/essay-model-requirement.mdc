# Essay Writing: Opus 4.6 Only

When writing, editing, or substantially revising article/essay content, **always use the main agent (Opus 4.6)**. Never delegate essay writing to subagents using faster or less capable models.

## What This Covers

- Drafting new articles
- Rewriting or substantially editing existing prose
- Writing debate scripts
- Crafting share summaries, article excerpts, and frontmatter copy

## What This Does NOT Cover

Routine tasks that don't require top-tier prose quality can still use faster models:

- Chart definitions (`chart_defs.py` data and JS)
- Build system changes
- File searches and codebase exploration
- Image generation prompts
- Deploying, committing, running scripts
