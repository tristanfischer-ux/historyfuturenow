# Article Image Requirements

Every essay MUST have its own hero image.

## Image System

- Images live in `hfn-site-output/images/articles/{slug}/hero.{ext}`
- Supported formats: `png`, `webp`, `jpg` (checked in that order)
- The build system discovers images by slug directory — the frontmatter `image:` field is NOT used

## Requirements

- **Every article must have a hero image** in its own slug directory
- Images should be editorial illustrations that capture the article's theme
- Used for: article hero, section listing thumbnails, homepage cards, OG/social sharing

## When Writing a New Article

1. Create the directory: `hfn-site-output/images/articles/{slug}/`
2. Generate or source an appropriate hero image
3. Save as `hero.png` (preferred), `hero.webp`, or `hero.jpg`

## When Reviewing Articles

If an article has no hero image directory or no `hero.*` file, flag it as incomplete.
