# Article Reader Experience

The reader must finish every article feeling delightedly enlightened — smarter, surprised, and glad they read it.

## The Enlightenment Rule

- Every article must teach the reader something they genuinely did not know
- The historical sections are the primary vehicle — most readers know little history, so this is where the "I had no idea" moments live
- **The test:** Could the reader explain the core argument to a friend at dinner, with at least one historical fact they didn't know before?

## The Chuckle Hook

- Every article must contain at least **one moment of unexpected, clever language** in the **first third** of the article
- Dry wit, an unexpected historical parallel phrased memorably, a sardonic aside
- Not slapstick — think "the kind of line you'd read aloud to someone"
- This hooks the reader early and signals that the writing has personality; viral sharing starts with that early "you have to read this" moment
- Examples of the right register: "Augustus tried tax breaks for parents. It worked about as well as it does now." / "The Ottoman Empire ran a multinational state for six centuries, which is five centuries longer than the EU has managed so far."

## Shareable Ending

- Every article must end with a line or insight that makes the reader want to send it to someone
- The final paragraph should be quotable — the kind of line you'd text to a friend or paste into a chat
- Viral growth depends on readers finishing and thinking "X needs to see this"; the ending is where that impulse is triggered

## Word Count

- **Target:** 1,500–3,000 words
- Match length to the argument — a tightly argued 2,000-word piece is better than a padded 3,000-word one
- Not every topic needs 3,000 words. Some need 1,500. None need 4,000.

## When Reviewing Articles

- If the article teaches nothing new, it is incomplete
- If there is no moment of wit in the first third, flag it
- If the ending doesn't feel shareable, strengthen it
- If the article exceeds 3,000 words, cut until every section earns its place
