# Chart Temporal Coverage and Shareability

Charts are not decorations. They are arguments made visible.

## Temporal Coverage

- **Target:** Every chart should show the full arc — historic, present, and future — so readers see where we came from and where we are heading
- **Minimum:** Historic + present. No chart should show only a single point in time without context
- **Future projections:** Include where credible data or reasonable extrapolation exists. Label projections clearly (dashed lines, "projected" annotation)
- **When future data doesn't exist:** The chart should still contextualise the present within the historical arc. A chart showing 200 years of data with the present at the right edge implicitly asks "what comes next?"

## Two Versions of Every Chart

### 1. Interactive Version (in-article)
- Chart.js canvas embedded in the article page
- Hover tooltips, responsive sizing
- Defined in `hfn-build-system/chart_defs.py` as per existing system

### 2. Static Image Version (for sharing)
- Pre-rendered PNG export of the chart
- Must include: title, axis labels, source citation, and the HFN URL watermark
- Stored at `hfn-site-output/images/articles/{slug}/chart-{id}.png`
- Must be legible and meaningful without the surrounding article text
- Optimised for social media dimensions (1200x630 for OG, 1080x1080 for square)

## Standalone Shareability

Each static chart image must work as a standalone piece of content:
- Clear title that states the insight, not just the topic ("Fertility rates have halved since 1960" not "Fertility rates")
- Source citation visible in the image
- One-line contextual caption where needed
- HFN URL watermark (small, bottom-right)

## Per-Chart Share Button

- Each chart in the article gets a share button
- The share button opens a dialog offering: X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Email, Copy Link
- Share text includes the article's `share_summary` (140 chars) from frontmatter
- The shared content includes the static chart image

## When Reviewing Charts

- If a chart shows only the present with no historical context, flag it
- If no static image version exists, flag it as incomplete
- If the static image is illegible at social media dimensions, fix it
