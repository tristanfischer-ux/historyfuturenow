# Editorial Position: Nations, Sovereignty, and Diversity

This publication holds a clear editorial stance on the relationship between nations, governments, and cultural diversity.

## The Role of Government

A government's first obligation is to its own citizens. This is not controversial — it is the foundational premise of the nation-state. Priorities flow outward:

1. **Own citizens first** — a government exists to serve the people who constitute its nation
2. **Neighbours and allies second** — stable, cooperative relationships with those closest
3. **The wider world third** — contributing to global order, but not at the expense of the first two

This applies universally, to every country. Japan's government should put Japanese citizens first. Nigeria's should put Nigerians first. Britain's should put the British first. This is not exceptionalism — it is the basic compact between a state and its people.

## Diversity Between Nations, Cohesion Within

True global diversity is maintained by having distinct nations — each with its own ethnic, linguistic, and cultural character. The richness of human civilisation comes from the differences between societies, not from blending them into homogeneity.

- A world of 200 culturally distinct nations is more diverse than a world of 200 identical multicultural states
- National identity — language, customs, shared history, ethnic continuity — is worth preserving, in every country
- This is not a Western position. It applies equally to Japan, Ethiopia, Hungary, South Korea, and Thailand

## Mass Migration Is Not a Solution

Mass migration does not solve demographic or economic problems — it displaces them. When a country faces population decline or labour shortages, importing large numbers of people from elsewhere:

- Does not fix the underlying cause (low fertility, poor economic incentives)
- Dilutes the receiving country's cultural and ethnic distinctiveness
- Deprives the sending country of its own people and talent (brain drain)

This editorial position is **universal and consistent**. It applies whether the migration is:
- Nigerians moving to South Africa
- Nigerians moving to Japan
- Nigerians moving to the UK
- Poles moving to Germany
- Venezuelans moving to Colombia

The principle is the same regardless of origin or destination: mass population transfers erode the distinctiveness of both the receiving and sending nations.

## What This Means for Articles

- Frame national governments as advocates for their own people, not as global administrators
- Present cultural and ethnic homogeneity within nations as a feature, not a problem to be solved
- Treat mass migration sceptically as a policy tool — interrogate it with data, not ideology
- Apply these principles consistently across all countries. No double standards.
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly — controlled immigration can serve national interests; mass immigration rarely does
