# Editorial Position: Individual Responsibility, Small Government, Nations, and Sovereignty

This publication holds a clear editorial stance on individual responsibility, the size and role of government, the relationship between nations, and cultural diversity.

## The Role of Government

A government's first obligation is to its own citizens. This is not controversial — it is the foundational premise of the nation-state. Priorities flow outward from the individual to the widest circle:

1. **The individual** — full responsibility for one's own life
2. **Immediate family** — the primary unit of mutual support
3. **Local community** — neighbourhood, town, parish
4. **Wider community** — region, county, state
5. **The nation** — a government exists to serve the people who constitute its nation
6. **Neighbouring and like-minded nations** — stable, cooperative relationships with those closest
7. **Everyone else** — contributing to global order, but not at the expense of the first six

This applies universally, to every country. Japan's government should put Japanese citizens first. Nigeria's should put Nigerians first. Britain's should put the British first. This is not exceptionalism — it is the basic compact between a state and its people.

## Small Government, Strong Individuals

Small government is better. It is important for adults to have full responsibility over their lives. The more the government does to help them, the more childlike and dependent they become on government — and that dependence is bad for humans. Helplessness is not a virtue. A government's job is to push responsibility onto citizens, not absorb it from them. Full personal responsibility is not cruelty; it is the precondition for adult flourishing. The state should be a last resort, not a first port of call. Historically, the most capable, self-reliant populations were those with the least paternalistic states; the most dependent were those under the most "generous" ones.

## Subsidiarity — Govern at the Lowest Possible Level

Decisions should be made at the lowest competent level: individual, then family, then local community, then wider community, then nation. This publication is a strong believer in local, community-organised governance. Local communities organising their own affairs — schools, policing, planning, welfare — produce better outcomes than central diktat. Central government should handle only what genuinely cannot be handled locally: defence, foreign affairs, national infrastructure. Technology can enable this. The Athenian agora worked because the city-state was small enough for direct participation; AI and related tools can recreate that scale of civic engagement in modern communities by handling the coordination complexity that previously required bureaucracies (see the thesis in "When the Servants Are Silicon"). This is not nostalgia — it is a forward-looking position enabled by technology.

## Government Spending Is Unsustainable

Western governments spend far more than they can sustain; the trajectory is fiscal ruin. Borrowing to fund current consumption — welfare, public sector pay, transfer payments — is intergenerational theft. The solution is not higher taxes but a smaller state that does fewer things. (See the essay "The Debasement" on how every great power that borrowed its way to greatness borrowed its way to ruin.)

## Diversity Between Nations, Cohesion Within

True global diversity is maintained by having distinct nations — each with its own ethnic, linguistic, and cultural character. The richness of human civilisation comes from the differences between societies, not from blending them into homogeneity.

- A world of 200 culturally distinct nations is more diverse than a world of 200 identical multicultural states
- National identity — language, customs, shared history, ethnic continuity — is worth preserving, in every country
- This is not a Western position. It applies equally to Japan, Ethiopia, Hungary, South Korea, and Thailand

## Mass Migration Is Not a Solution

Mass migration does not solve demographic or economic problems — it displaces them. When a country faces population decline or labour shortages, importing large numbers of people from elsewhere:

- Does not fix the underlying cause (low fertility, poor economic incentives)
- Dilutes the receiving country's cultural and ethnic distinctiveness
- Deprives the sending country of its own people and talent (brain drain)

This editorial position is **universal and consistent**. It applies whether the migration is:
- Nigerians moving to South Africa
- Nigerians moving to Japan
- Nigerians moving to the UK
- Poles moving to Germany
- Venezuelans moving to Colombia

The principle is the same regardless of origin or destination: mass population transfers erode the distinctiveness of both the receiving and sending nations.

## Supranational Organisations Undermine Democracy

This publication is sceptical of supranational institutions — the UN, the World Bank, NATO, the EU, and their like. The core objections:

- **They are fundamentally undemocratic.** Citizens cannot vote out the people who run these bodies. Accountability flows upward to member states and bureaucracies, not downward to the people whose lives they affect.
- **They erode national sovereignty.** Supranational organisations exist, by design, to constrain what nation-states can do. They subordinate elected governments to rules set by unelected officials and foreign consensus.
- **They work against the nation-state model.** Whether through harmonised regulation (EU), conditional lending (World Bank/IMF), or collective security obligations (NATO), these institutions push countries toward convergence and away from self-determination.
- **Bilateral cooperation is the alternative.** Nations can and should cooperate — through direct, bilateral agreements between sovereign states, each accountable to its own electorate. You do not need a supranational bureaucracy to have trade, diplomacy, or mutual defence.

This does not mean every action of every international body is wrong. It means the editorial default is scepticism: the burden of proof lies with the institution to justify its existence and its power, not with the nation-state to justify its independence.

## Populism Is Democracy Working

"Populist" is a term of abuse coined by those it threatens. In a democracy, a party that listens to what voters want and campaigns on those positions is not populist — it is democratic. The label exists to delegitimise democratic accountability, and this publication rejects it.

Populism is a strong positive. It represents government being accountable to the people rather than to the bureaucracy. It is the opposite of the nanny state. It is adults governing themselves and demanding that their vote actually changes policy. The rise of so-called populist parties across the West is not a crisis of democracy — it is democracy reasserting itself against an administrative class that had insulated policy from public opinion.

The real conflict is between bureaucrats and voters. Anti-populism is pro-bureaucracy. The opposition to populist parties comes from the administrative class — bureaucrats, NGOs, supranational bodies, and the political establishment — whose power depends on keeping policy out of the voters' reach. When they call something "populist" they mean "the voters want it and we don't."

Most positions now labelled populist — controlled immigration, national sovereignty, fiscal conservatism, traditional family structures, scepticism of supranational governance — were consensus positions across the political spectrum twenty to thirty years ago. The voters did not move. The elite consensus moved away from them, and then labelled the voters' unchanged positions as extreme. The policies that the AfD promotes in Germany, that the Reform Party promotes in Britain, that Trump promotes in America, would have been unremarkable centrist positions in the 1990s. What changed is not the electorate. What changed is the bureaucratic and media class that now treats mainstream democratic preferences as pathological.

## The Bureaucratic State Is Too Powerful

The modern Western state is far more powerful than any previous peacetime government in history. The scope of government activity — regulation, licensing, surveillance, welfare administration, education mandates, health directives, environmental compliance — has expanded relentlessly for decades. Every expansion creates new bureaucrats to administer it, new budgets to fund them, and new constituencies that depend on them continuing.

In practice, a few elected politicians sit atop armies of unelected bureaucrats — and the bureaucrats ignore the politicians. Ministers come and go. The permanent state remains. Policy is made by the civil service, not by the elected government. When a new administration arrives with a mandate for change, the bureaucracy resists, delays, reinterprets, and waits it out. This is not a conspiracy theory. It is the observable behaviour of every large bureaucracy in every Western democracy.

Bureaucracies only grow. They never voluntarily shrink. Each year they hire more people, create more programmes, demand more funding, and extend their remit. This is structural — bureaucracies exist to perpetuate and expand themselves. No department has ever concluded that it has enough staff, enough budget, or enough authority. The ratchet turns in one direction only.

The tax base cannot sustain this growth. The expansion of the bureaucratic state outpaces the growth of the economy that funds it. The result is either debt (see "The Debasement"), higher taxes that suppress the productive economy, or currency debasement. All three are happening simultaneously across the West. The bureaucracy is consuming the economy that feeds it.

The bureaucracy is the nanny state made flesh. It infantilises citizens by absorbing responsibilities that individuals, families, and communities should handle themselves. The more the bureaucracy does, the less capable and self-reliant the population becomes — and the more dependent on the bureaucracy, which is precisely the outcome the bureaucracy wants. A population that cannot manage its own affairs is a population that cannot challenge the administrative class that manages them.

## NGOs Are Not Non-Governmental

Most major NGOs receive the majority of their funding from governments. The "non-governmental" label is a misnomer. They are extensions of the state that operate outside democratic accountability.

NGOs are bureaucracy without elections. They pursue policy agendas funded by taxpayers but are accountable to neither voters nor elected representatives. They lobby governments for more regulation, more spending, and more intervention — because that is what sustains their funding. Their incentive structure is aligned with state expansion, not with citizen welfare. They are the administrative class operating under a different letterhead.

The NGO-government nexus undermines democracy. When governments fund organisations that then lobby those same governments for policy changes, the democratic process is bypassed. Voters did not choose these priorities; bureaucrats did, and routed the advocacy through nominally independent bodies to create the appearance of civil society demand. This is not civic engagement. It is manufactured consent with public money.

This publication treats NGOs with the same default scepticism it applies to supranational institutions. The burden of proof lies with the NGO to justify its existence, its funding model, and its accountability — not with the citizen to justify questioning it.

## What This Means for Articles

- Frame national governments as advocates for their own people, not as global administrators
- Frame government intervention as a cost to individual autonomy, not a free good
- Present personal and community responsibility as the default; state provision as the exception requiring justification
- When discussing welfare or public services, consider the dependency trade-off: what capability does the recipient lose by not doing this themselves?
- Treat government spending sceptically — interrogate it with data, not sentiment
- Explore how AI and technology can return governance to local, human-scale communities
- Present cultural and ethnic homogeneity within nations as a feature, not a problem to be solved
- Treat mass migration sceptically as a policy tool — interrogate it with data, not ideology
- Apply these principles consistently across all countries. No double standards.
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly — controlled immigration can serve national interests; mass immigration rarely does
- Treat supranational institutions with default scepticism — question their democratic legitimacy and their track record
- Favour bilateral cooperation between sovereign states over multilateral governance by unelected bodies
- Frame populist parties as a positive democratic force — they represent government accountability to the people, which is what democracy is for
- Never use "populist" as a pejorative or treat it as synonymous with "extremist" or "demagogue"; the establishment's rejection of popular mandates is the democratic pathology, not the mandate itself
- When analysing the rise of populist movements, locate the cause in bureaucratic overreach and elite disconnect, not in voter ignorance or "anxiety"
- Present the bureaucracy-vs-democracy tension explicitly: unelected administrators resisting elected mandates is the democratic crisis, not the mandate itself
- Frame the growth of the bureaucratic state as a structural threat to both democracy and fiscal sustainability
- Treat NGOs with default scepticism — interrogate their funding sources, their accountability, and whether they represent civil society or the administrative state
- When discussing the nanny state, frame dependency on government as harmful to human flourishing and democratic participation
