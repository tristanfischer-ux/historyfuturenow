# Article Sharing

Every article must be easy to share. Sharing drives readership.

## Share Buttons

- **Placement:** Share buttons appear at the **top** and **bottom** of every article
- **Platforms:** X (Twitter), LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Email, Copy Link
- **Per-chart sharing:** Each chart also gets its own share button (see `article-charts-temporal.mdc`)

## Share Text Formats

- **X / LinkedIn:** `"{Article title}" — {share_summary} {URL}`
- **WhatsApp / Email:** Include the article excerpt (from frontmatter) plus URL
- **Copy Link:** Just the URL

## Frontmatter Requirements

Every article's YAML frontmatter must include:

```yaml
share_summary: >-
  A pithy, shareable thesis in 140 characters or fewer.
```

This is the bite-sized version of the article's argument — what someone would tweet.

## OG and Social Meta Tags

- `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url` must be present and correct
- `twitter:card` must be `summary_large_image`
- The hero image must be the `og:image`
- These are already generated by `build.py` — this rule ensures they stay current

## Implementation

- Share buttons are injected by `build.py` during the build
- Share logic lives in `hfn-site-output/js/share.js`
- Share button styles live in `hfn-site-output/css/style.css`

## When Reviewing Articles

- If an article has no share buttons, the build is broken — fix it
- If `share_summary` is missing from frontmatter, write one before publishing
- If OG tags are missing or stale, flag it
