# Article Hero Image Art Style

All hero images across the site must follow a **consistent visual style**. The canonical reference is the style used for "The Robot Bargain" and "The Silence of the Scribes" articles.

## The Style: Flat Geometric Editorial Illustration

Every hero image must be a **flat, geometric, modernist editorial illustration** — think mid-century modern poster art crossed with editorial infographics.

### Required Characteristics

- **Flat shapes and bold silhouettes** — no realistic rendering, no painterly textures, no gradients that simulate 3D depth
- **Geometric and stylised** — figures, buildings, and objects are reduced to clean geometric forms, not anatomically detailed
- **Limited, deliberate colour palette** — typically 4–6 colours per image, drawn from warm earth tones (terracotta, ochre, sand, navy, muted teal, cream, charcoal). Avoid neon or saturated primaries.
- **Strong compositional structure** — clear visual hierarchy, balanced layout, often uses horizontal bands or layered planes
- **Minimal texture** — flat colour fills, not brushstrokes or photographic texture. Subtle grain is acceptable but not dominant.
- **Symbolic, not literal** — convey the article's theme through visual metaphor and iconography, not a literal scene
- **No photorealism** — no realistic faces, no detailed landscapes, no oil-painting aesthetics
- **Clean lines** — crisp edges between colour areas, not soft or blended

### Colour Guidance

Use the warm, muted editorial palette consistent across the site:
- Terracotta / burnt orange (#C4704B range)
- Deep navy / dark blue (#2B3A5C range)
- Sand / cream (#F5E6D0 range)
- Muted teal (#5B8A8A range)
- Warm grey / charcoal (#4A4A4A range)
- Ochre / gold (#D4A843 range)
- Dusty rose / muted red (#B85C5C range)

Accent colours are fine but should remain muted and editorial, never garish.

### What to Avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Realistic / painterly style | Looks like concept art or AI "fantasy art" — inconsistent with the editorial brand |
| Detailed faces or anatomy | The style uses simplified, geometric figures |
| Heavy texture or brushstrokes | Breaks the flat, clean aesthetic |
| Photographic depth of field | This is graphic design, not photography |
| Bright saturated colours | The palette is warm and muted, not vivid |
| Busy, cluttered compositions | Each image should have clear negative space and visual breathing room |

### Prompt Guidance (for AI Image Generation)

When generating hero images, use prompts that include terms like:
- "flat geometric editorial illustration"
- "mid-century modern poster style"
- "bold silhouettes, limited colour palette"
- "stylised, minimalist, warm earth tones"
- "editorial infographic illustration"
- "clean lines, no texture, flat colour"

Explicitly exclude:
- "realistic", "photorealistic", "detailed", "painterly"
- "oil painting", "concept art", "fantasy art"
- "3D render", "photograph"

## When Reviewing Images

- If a hero image uses a realistic or painterly style, flag it for regeneration
- If the colour palette is too saturated or inconsistent with the site palette, flag it
- If the image has heavy texture, detailed faces, or photographic qualities, flag it
- The test: does this image look like it belongs next to "The Robot Bargain" and "The Silence of the Scribes"? If not, regenerate it.
