# Article Media Suite

No article is complete until its full media suite is generated.

## Required Media Per Article

### 1. Hero Image
- Location: `hfn-site-output/images/articles/{slug}/hero.{png|webp|jpg}`
- Already enforced by `article-images-required.mdc`
- Editorial illustration capturing the article's theme

### 2. Thumbnail Images
- Generated from the hero image at smaller dimensions
- Used for: section listing cards, homepage cards, social previews
- Sizes: 600x400 (card), 300x200 (thumbnail), 1200x630 (OG)
- Stored alongside the hero image in the same slug directory

### 3. Audio Article Narration
- A **two-person conversational reading** of the article by James and Elena
- This is NOT a solo narrator — it is James and Elena discussing the article's content as they present it
- James leads the narrative; Elena adds commentary, reactions, and emphasis
- Generated by `generate_audio.py` (updated for two-voice format)
- Output: `hfn-site-output/audio/{slug}.mp3`

### 4. Audio Debate
- James and Elena **debating** the article's thesis
- See `article-debate-dynamics.mdc` for character rules
- 25–40 turns, 1,500–2,500 words, targeting 8–12 minutes
- Generated by `generate_discussions.py`
- Output: `hfn-site-output/audio/discussions/{slug}.mp3`

### 5. Static Chart Images
- PNG export of every chart in the article
- For social sharing (see `article-charts-temporal.mdc`)
- Location: `hfn-site-output/images/articles/{slug}/chart-{id}.png`
