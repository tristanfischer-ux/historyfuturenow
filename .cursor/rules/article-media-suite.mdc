# Article Media Suite

No article is complete until its full media suite is generated.

## Required Media Per Article

### 1. Hero Image
- Location: `hfn-site-output/images/articles/{slug}/hero.{png|webp|jpg}`
- Already enforced by `article-images-required.mdc`
- Editorial illustration capturing the article's theme

### 2. Thumbnail Images
- Generated from the hero image at smaller dimensions
- Used for: section listing cards, homepage cards, social previews
- Sizes: 600x400 (card), 300x200 (thumbnail), 1200x630 (OG)
- Stored alongside the hero image in the same slug directory

### 3. Audio Article Narration
- A **straight read-through** of the article text with **two alternating British voices** — one male, one female
- This is a narration, not a discussion. The voices alternate by section or paragraph to keep the listening experience varied and engaging.
- The male and female voices are both Received Pronunciation / BBC-style British English
- Generated by `generate_audio.py`
- Output: `hfn-site-output/audio/{slug}.mp3`

### 4. Audio Debate — PAUSED
- **Currently disabled** via `ENABLE_DISCUSSIONS=False` in `build.py`
- Existing scripts and audio preserved on disk
- Do not generate new debates until re-enabled
- When re-enabled: James and Elena debating the article's thesis (see `article-debate-dynamics.mdc`)

### 5. Static Chart Images
- PNG export of every chart in the article
- For social sharing (see `article-charts-temporal.mdc`)
- Location: `hfn-site-output/images/articles/{slug}/chart-{id}.png`

## Completeness Check

An article is **not ready to publish** until all of the following exist:
- [ ] Hero image
- [ ] Thumbnail images
- [ ] Audio narration (two-voice)
- [ ] ~~Audio debate~~ (paused — not required)
- [ ] Static chart images for every chart
- [ ] `share_summary` in frontmatter
