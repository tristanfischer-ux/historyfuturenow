# Article Chart Requirements

Every essay MUST include at least **1** appropriate chart. The norm is **2-5 charts per article**.

## Guidelines

- **Minimum:** 1 chart per article. No article ships without at least one visualization.
- **Target range:** 2-5 charts. This is the sweet spot for most essays.
- **Maximum:** Use judgment. More than 5 is fine if the data warrants it, but don't pad with filler charts.

## What Makes a Chart "Appropriate"

- Directly supports a claim or argument in the text
- Visualizes data the reader would otherwise have to imagine
- Uses the correct chart type for the data (bar for comparisons, line for trends, etc.)
- Includes a clear title, source citation, and descriptive label

## When Adding Charts

1. Charts are defined in `hfn-build-system/chart_defs.py`
2. Each chart needs: `id`, `figure_num`, `title`, `desc`, `source`, `position`, and `js`
3. Use the shared `COLORS` theme and helper functions (`ds`, `dxy`, `gridOpts`, etc.)
4. Position charts near the paragraph or heading that references the data

## When Reviewing Articles

If an article has zero charts, flag it as incomplete. If it has only one, consider whether additional visualizations would strengthen the argument.
