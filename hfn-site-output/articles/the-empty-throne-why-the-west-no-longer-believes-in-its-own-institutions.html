  <div class="article-body">
    <p>In January 2025, the Edelman Trust Barometer delivered its annual verdict on the state of public confidence across twenty-eight countries. The headline number — fifty-one per cent average trust in government — masked a collapse in most Western democracies. In the United States, trust in the federal government to &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; stood at sixteen per cent, down from seventy-seven per cent when Pew Research Center first asked the question in 1964. In the United Kingdom, twelve per cent of the public trusted Parliament to act in the national interest. In France, trust in political parties had fallen to nine per cent. The French, it appears, have rather more confidence in the weather forecast than in the people who govern them.</p>
<p>The Roman Senate lasted nine hundred years. The House of Lords has lasted eight hundred. The United States Congress has lasted 235 and already looks like it needs life support. At this rate, the European Parliament will be fortunate to see its centenary.</p>
<p>This is not a mood. It is not a polling blip that will correct with a better class of politician. It is a structural collapse in the legitimacy of the institutions that underpin Western civilisation: democratic government, the free press, the judiciary, the scientific establishment, organised religion, and the post-1945 international order. Gallup&rsquo;s long-running confidence surveys show that trust in virtually every major American institution — Congress, the presidency, the Supreme Court, newspapers, television news, organised religion, banks, public schools — has declined since the early 1970s, most of them precipitously. The pattern in Europe is the same. The question is whether any of this has happened before. The answer is yes — repeatedly, and with consequences that ranged from the transformative to the catastrophic.</p>
<h2>What Trust Is — and What Happens When It Goes</h2>
<p>Trust, in the context of institutions, is not a feeling. It is a calculation — a rational expectation that an institution will behave predictably, competently, and in the interests of those it serves. Francis Fukuyama, in <em>Trust</em>, argued that it is the foundation of social capital: the invisible infrastructure upon which everything else is built. High-trust societies — Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands — have lower transaction costs, less corruption, broader tax bases, and more effective public services. Low-trust societies — Russia, Brazil, Nigeria — must compensate with coercion, surveillance, and elaborate enforcement mechanisms that absorb productive capacity and breed resentment.</p>

<aside class="pull-quote"><p>The message was unmistakable: the Senate would kill its own members rather than permit reform that threatened senatorial wealth.</p></aside>


<p>The correlation is not coincidental. It reflects a simple dynamic: when people trust institutions, they cooperate voluntarily. When they do not, cooperation must be compelled — and compulsion is expensive, corrosive, and ultimately unsustainable. Tax compliance falls. Jury service is evaded. Voluntary regulation gives way to punitive enforcement. Public health guidance is ignored. The institution then performs worse — because it is spending its resources on enforcement rather than service — which confirms the public&rsquo;s distrust and accelerates the decline. It is a doom loop, and it has a ratchet: trust lost is far harder to rebuild than trust maintained.</p>
<p>Robert Putnam documented this in <em>Bowling Alone</em>: the decline in American civic participation — unions, churches, clubs, volunteer organisations — began in the 1960s and accelerated through the 1980s and 1990s. The institutions that had once embedded trust in daily life — the PTA, the Rotary Club, the local church — withered. What replaced them was television, then the internet, then social media: technologies that connected people to information but disconnected them from one another. The social fabric frayed before the political fabric did.</p>
<h2>When Rome Stopped Trusting the Senate</h2>
<p>For roughly four centuries, the Roman Senate was the most respected governing body in the ancient world. Roman citizens — even those who grumbled — broadly accepted that the Senate governed in the public interest. The crisis that destroyed this legitimacy began not with an invasion or a natural disaster, but with corruption so visible and so shameless that it could no longer be denied.</p>
<p>By the late second century BC, the Senate had been captured by a narrow oligarchy of wealthy families. Roman public land — the <em>ager publicus</em>, owned by the state and theoretically available for citizen settlement — had been overwhelmingly occupied by senatorial families in flagrant violation of existing law. The brothers Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus attempted to enforce the land limits and redistribute surplus to landless citizens — a moderate reform, entirely within existing legal frameworks. The Senate&rsquo;s response was murder. Tiberius was beaten to death by a mob of senators and their supporters in 133 BC — the first political killing in the Republic in nearly four centuries. Gaius was driven to suicide twelve years later. The message was unmistakable: the Senate would kill its own members rather than permit reform that threatened senatorial wealth.</p>
<p>The courts were corrupt — provincial governors looted with near-impunity, and the juries that theoretically held them accountable were their fellow senators. Elections were openly purchased; Marcus Licinius Crassus, the wealthiest man in Rome, effectively bought political influence by funding candidates and maintaining a private fire brigade that doubled as a protection racket. The result was a progressive transfer of loyalty from the Republic&rsquo;s collective institutions to individuals who promised to fix them. Gaius Marius, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus — each exploited the same dynamic. The public had lost faith in the institutions and was willing to vest extraordinary power in outsiders who promised to break the system open.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC not as a revolutionary but as a man whose popular support exceeded the Senate&rsquo;s institutional legitimacy. Within fifteen years of his assassination, Augustus had established a monarchy in all but name — and the public, exhausted by decades of institutional failure and civil war, accepted it with something approaching relief. The pattern is worth memorising, because it is the pattern we are living through: when institutions are captured by insiders who serve their own interests, the public transfers loyalty to outsiders who promise disruption.</p>
<h2>When Europe Stopped Trusting the Church</h2>
<p>The medieval Catholic Church was the closest thing Europe had to a continental government. It ran courts, collected taxes, conducted diplomacy, operated schools and universities, and provided the ideological framework that legitimised every monarch. Its authority rested on a claim to spiritual truth — and on a monopoly over the information infrastructure through which that truth was communicated. The Church controlled education, literacy, and the interpretation of the only texts most people ever encountered.</p>
<p>The erosion of faith took centuries, and it followed the same trajectory as Rome&rsquo;s: institutional capture, visible corruption, and the destruction of the credibility that legitimacy requires. Simony — the sale of ecclesiastical offices — was endemic. The Avignon Papacy, from 1309 to 1377, shattered the papacy&rsquo;s claim to spiritual independence by placing it under French control. The Great Western Schism, from 1378 to 1417, gave Europe two and then three rival popes, each excommunicating the others. For nearly forty years, Christians were told that the head of their Church was simultaneously in Rome, Avignon, and Pisa — a situation that would have tested the credulity of the most devout.</p>
<p>By the time Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door at Wittenberg in 1517, the kindling had been piling up for two hundred years. Luther was the match. The printing press — Gutenberg&rsquo;s invention, barely seventy years old — was the accelerant. Luther&rsquo;s theses and pamphlets reached a mass audience faster than the Church could suppress them, just as social media now disseminates criticism faster than institutions can respond.</p>
<p>The Reformation produced religious pluralism, the nation-state, the scientific revolution, and parliamentary governance. It also produced the Wars of Religion, which killed an estimated eight million people across Europe over the following century. The Thirty Years&rsquo; War alone killed perhaps a third of the German population. The transition from one institutional order to another is rarely gentle. The interval between &ldquo;the old order has lost legitimacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;a new order has established itself&rdquo; is the most dangerous period in the life of any civilisation.</p>
<p>The parallel with the modern media landscape is uncomfortably precise. The medieval Church was, functionally, the information monopoly of its age — it controlled what people knew, how they knew it, and who was authorised to interpret it. When the printing press shattered that monopoly, the result was not a smooth transition to enlightened pluralism. It was a century of information chaos, competing claims to truth, and eventually war. Social media has shattered the information monopoly of the twentieth-century press and broadcast establishment. The chaos phase has arrived. The question is whether what follows will be Reformation or merely fragmentation.</p>

<h2>The Modern Collapse</h2>
<p>The data on the current collapse of institutional trust is extensive, consistent across countries, and spans decades.</p>
<p>In the United States, Gallup has tracked confidence in institutions since 1973. Confidence in Congress has fallen from forty-two per cent to eight per cent. Newspapers from thirty-nine per cent to thirteen per cent. Television news from forty-six per cent to eleven per cent. The Supreme Court from forty-nine per cent to twenty-five per cent. Even the military — the last institution commanding broad respect — has declined from eighty-five per cent after the September 11 attacks to sixty per cent. In Europe, trust in the European Union fell from fifty-seven per cent in 2007 to thirty-five per cent in 2024. In six of seven G7 nations, fewer than half the population trusts their government.</p>
<p>Supranational institutions like the EU are uniquely vulnerable to this collapse — and not by accident. They have no direct democratic mandate. Citizens cannot vote out the European Commission, cannot reject EU directives at the ballot box, and have no meaningful say in the appointment of the officials who govern them. When a national government loses trust, the electorate can throw it out. When a supranational body does, there is no such recourse. The trust decline in Brussels is not a bug to be fixed by better communication. It is the predictable consequence of structures that were never designed to be accountable to the people they claim to serve.</p>
<p>The triggers are familiar: Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers revealed that the government was systematically lying. Watergate revealed that the president was a criminal. The Iraq War and the weapons of mass destruction that did not exist revealed that intelligence agencies could be weaponised for political purposes. The 2008 financial crisis revealed that regulators had been captured by the industries they were supposed to oversee — and that when the system failed, the bankers were bailed out while ordinary citizens lost their homes. The COVID-19 pandemic, with its contradictory public health guidance, shifting recommendations, and the perception of political interference in scientific advice, accelerated the erosion further.</p>

<p>But triggers are not causes. The structural cause is the same as in Rome and the medieval Church: institutions captured by their own personnel, serving their own interests rather than the public&rsquo;s. In the United States, over sixty per cent of former members of Congress who left office between 2000 and 2020 became lobbyists or advisers to the very industries they had overseen — a revolving door so brazen it would have embarrassed a Roman senator. Ronald Inglehart, in <em>Cultural Evolution</em>, demonstrated that trust has fallen fastest among those without university degrees, in rural areas, and among those whose real wages have stagnated — the people who feel, often with justification, that the system is rigged.</p>
<h2>What Fills the Vacuum</h2>
<p>The empty throne never stays empty. In Rome, the vacuum was filled by strongmen — Marius, Sulla, Caesar, Augustus. In Reformation Europe, by new institutions — national churches, nation-states, parliamentary democracy, the free press. In the modern West, three forces are rushing in.</p>
<p>The first is populist leadership. Trump, Orbán, Meloni, Milei — whatever their differences in policy, they share a single appeal: they are not the establishment. Their voters are not voting for a programme. They are voting against the institutions they no longer trust.</p>
<p>The second is alternative epistemologies. When people stop trusting institutions to tell them the truth, they seek truth elsewhere. Conspiracy theories, alternative medicine, partisan media, and algorithmic echo chambers are not causes of the trust collapse; they are symptoms of it. To characterise these responses as &ldquo;disinformation&rdquo; or &ldquo;post-truth&rdquo; locates the problem in the public rather than in the institutions. But the Romans who supported Caesar were not deluded. The Germans who read Luther were not victims of misinformation. They were people responding rationally to institutional failure.</p>

<p>The third is algorithmic trust. Among under-twenty-fives, thirty per cent now use TikTok as a primary news source; fifteen per cent read a daily newspaper. Trust is migrating from institutional brands — the BBC, the <em>New York Times</em>, Reuters — to individual creators and algorithmic curation. Whether this represents a democratisation of truth or its fragmentation is the defining information question of the decade.</p>
<h2>What Comes Next</h2>
<p>The current crisis is not a passing mood. It is a structural transformation of the kind that occurs perhaps once or twice per millennium — comparable in scope, if not yet in violence, to the fall of the Roman Republic and the Protestant Reformation. The decline that began in the late 1960s has now lasted over fifty years and shows no sign of reversing.</p>
<p>No amount of &ldquo;rebuilding trust&rdquo; through better communications or public relations will fix it. The problem is performance, not perception. Institutions that manifestly serve their own personnel rather than the public cannot talk their way back to legitimacy. They must either reform — which means those who benefit from the current arrangement must accept less — or be replaced.</p>
<p>The new institutional order is already emerging in fragments. Estonia governs through a digital-first system that makes most traditional bureaucracy unnecessary — ninety-nine per cent of government services are available online, and the system is transparent by design. Switzerland&rsquo;s binding referenda give citizens direct control over policy decisions that in other democracies are left to legislators and lobbyists. Network-based trust — peer reviews, open-source verification, blockchain provenance, algorithmic transparency — is bypassing traditional gatekeepers in finance, journalism, and science.</p>

<p>The institutions of the post-war order will either reform themselves or be replaced. The Roman Senate was hollowed out. The medieval Church was broken into pieces. The question is not whether Western institutions will be transformed — that is already happening. The question is whether the transformation will be managed or chaotic, and whether what emerges will be better or worse. The throne is empty. Someone will claim it. Send that to anyone who still thinks this is just a bad year for polling numbers.</p>
