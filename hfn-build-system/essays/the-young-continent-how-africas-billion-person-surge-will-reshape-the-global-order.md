# The Young Continent: How Africa's Billion-Person Surge Will Reshape the Global Order

The median age in Niger is 15.6 years. Half the country has not yet reached secondary school. In Japan, the median age is 49.9 — half the population is closer to retirement than to childbirth. These two numbers, separated by thirty-four years and several thousand kilometres, describe the single most consequential demographic divergence in the modern world. One civilisation is running out of people. Another is producing them at a pace not seen since Europe's own population explosion in the nineteenth century.

Africa's population today stands at approximately 1.46 billion. The UN Population Division projects it will reach 2.5 billion by 2050 and could approach 3.8 billion by 2100. By the end of this century, roughly one in three humans will be African. Europe, which spent five centuries colonising Africa and extracting its resources — its minerals, its rubber, its people — is now discovering that demographics have a rather well-developed sense of irony. The EU's working-age population is projected to shrink by fifty million by 2050. That is Europe's problem to solve — through automation, productivity gains, and pension reform — not Africa's burden to absorb. Meanwhile, the continent Europe spent centuries treating as a mine is accumulating the economic weight, mineral leverage, and geopolitical agency to reshape the global order on its own terms. The question is no longer whether Africa will do so. It is whether the rest of the world will have the wit to notice before the reshaping is complete.

## The Numbers That Cannot Be Undone

The most important thing to understand about Africa's demographic surge is that it is already locked in. The children who will be Africa's workers, consumers, entrepreneurs, and migrants in 2050 have already been born, or will be born to mothers who have already been born. No policy, no programme, no catastrophe short of pandemic-scale mortality can alter the trajectory within a generation.

In 1960, sub-Saharan Africa's population was approximately 227 million — smaller than the United States at the time. Today it exceeds 1.2 billion. The continent adds roughly thirty million people per year, the equivalent of a new Peru, every twelve months. Nigeria, currently the seventh most populous nation at approximately 224 million, is projected by the UN to reach 375 million by 2050, overtaking the United States to become the world's third most populous country. The Democratic Republic of the Congo will grow from 102 million to an estimated 215 million. Ethiopia will reach 213 million. Tanzania will exceed 130 million. By mid-century, Africa will contain at least five nations with populations exceeding one hundred million — and the combined population of its ten largest countries will exceed the current population of China.

Fertility rates are declining across the continent — the average sub-Saharan African woman had 6.7 children in 1980; today the figure is approximately 4.6. But the decline is from a baseline so extraordinarily high, and the existing population of childbearing age is so large, that the decline itself produces growth for decades before stabilising. Niger's fertility rate of 6.7 children per woman remains the highest in the world. Mali, Chad, and Somalia are above 6.0. Even Nigeria, with a more urbanised economy, sits at 5.1. The historian John Iliffe, in *Africans: The History of a Continent*, argued that Africa's demographic history has always been defined by the struggle against underpopulation rather than overpopulation — disease, slavery, and thin soils kept numbers low for millennia while other continents filled up. Africa is finally, belatedly, filling up. And the world is not remotely prepared for the consequences.

## When the Centre of Gravity Shifted Before

For most of the past two millennia, the world's two largest economies were China and India — because they had the most people. Economic output and population were functionally the same thing until the Industrial Revolution temporarily severed the connection. The great anomaly of the past two centuries — a small western peninsula containing perhaps twenty per cent of the world's population controlling perhaps eighty per cent of its economic output — was made possible by coal, steam, and mechanised industry, not by any inherent superiority.

That anomaly is closing, and it is closing faster than most Western policymakers appreciate. China's rise since 1978 is the reassertion of demographic weight through industrialisation — the most people, given access to modern technology and capital, producing the most output. India's rise is the next iteration. Africa's will be the one after that. McKinsey's Global Institute has tracked the world's economic centre of gravity geographically: in 1950 it sat in the mid-Atlantic, reflecting American and European dominance. By 2025 it had shifted to the eastern Mediterranean. By 2050 it will sit somewhere over the Indian Ocean, pulled south and east by the weight of Asian and African populations.

The Mediterranean was the centre of the ancient world because that was where the people were. The Atlantic was the centre of the modern world for the same reason. The next shift will be towards the Indian Ocean basin and Africa. Not because anyone wills it — because that is where the people will be.

If Africa's GDP per capita in 2050 matches India's today — roughly $2,500, well below any optimistic scenario — the continent's total GDP would exceed six trillion dollars, larger than Japan's current economy. The United States in 1800 had 5.3 million people; by 1950 it had 152 million. That surge — fuelled by immigration and high fertility — was the demographic foundation of American dominance. Africa in 2025, with 1.4 billion people and a median age of 18.8, is at a comparable demographic inflection point. The weight of numbers has always, eventually, asserted itself. The only question is whether Africa can convert demographic mass into economic power before the window narrows.

## The New Scramble

In 1884, fourteen European nations gathered at the Berlin Conference to divide Africa among themselves. No Africans were invited. A century and a half later, the scramble has resumed — with different participants, similar motivations, and one crucial difference.

China has poured an estimated $170 billion into African infrastructure since the Belt and Road Initiative launched in 2013: railways in Kenya and Ethiopia, ports in Djibouti and Tanzania, dams, telecommunications networks, and government buildings across the continent. China is now Africa's largest bilateral trading partner, with total trade reaching $296 billion in 2024. The model is transactional — infrastructure in exchange for mining concessions, port access, and political alignment at the United Nations. Turkey has expanded aggressively into the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, building military bases in Somalia and selling drones to multiple African governments. Russia, through the Wagner Group — now rebranded as Africa Corps — operates in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, the Central African Republic, Libya, and Sudan, offering military muscle and diplomatic cover without the lectures on human rights that Western engagement inevitably includes. India's trade with Africa exceeds one hundred billion dollars annually.

India's trade with Africa exceeds one hundred billion dollars annually, increasingly focused on pharmaceuticals — India supplies roughly seventy per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's generic medicines — and technology services.

The conspicuous absentee is the United States. American trade with sub-Saharan Africa is roughly forty-four billion dollars — less than a sixth of China's — and declining in relative terms despite several summits and pledges. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, the primary US trade framework, has been renewed sporadically and with diminishing ambition. France, the former colonial power with the deepest Francophone footprint, is being systematically expelled from its former colonies: Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad have all either expelled French forces or demanded their departure since 2021. The mood across much of West and Central Africa is openly anti-French and, by extension, sceptical of Western engagement generally.

The critical difference from 1884 is agency. African governments are no longer passive recipients of external decisions. They play external powers against one another with considerable sophistication. When the DRC's government was dissatisfied with the terms of a Chinese mining deal, it renegotiated — extracting better royalty rates and local employment requirements. When Mali expelled French forces, it invited Russian military support on its own terms. When Kenya needed a railway, it took Chinese financing but insisted on technology transfer provisions. Nigeria, Ethiopia, and the Sahel states negotiate terms, extract concessions, and shift allegiances in ways that would have been unthinkable a generation ago. The scramble is multipolar — and this time, Africa has a seat at the table.

The mineral dimension deserves emphasis. Africa holds roughly thirty per cent of the world's mineral reserves, including the cobalt, lithium, platinum, and rare earths that the green energy transition demands. The DRC alone produces over seventy per cent of global cobalt. South Africa dominates platinum group metals. Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves. These minerals will be to the twenty-first century what oil was to the twentieth — and they are overwhelmingly African. The continent that Europe treated as a source of raw materials will remain a source of raw materials; the difference is that African governments now have leverage, alternatives, and the sophistication to use both.

## The Dividend or the Detonator

Whether Africa's demographic surge becomes a dividend or a detonator depends on a single variable: jobs.

The continent must create roughly twenty million new jobs per year to absorb the young people entering its workforce. It is currently creating a fraction of that number. Africa remains a net food importer despite containing sixty per cent of the world's uncultivated arable land — a paradox rooted in underinvestment in agricultural productivity, land tenure insecurity, and the lingering distortions of colonial cash-crop economies. Governance ranges from Botswana's quiet competence to Somalia's anarchic collapse. Lake Chad has shrunk by ninety per cent since the 1960s — a loss that has directly fed the displacement, desperation, and recruitment pool that sustains the Boko Haram insurgency. Climate change will hit Africa harder than any continent except perhaps South Asia, compounding water stress, reducing crop yields, and driving migration.

The pessimistic scenario is real and it is already playing out in parts of the Sahel, the Horn, and the Great Lakes region. But it is not the whole story.

The grounds for cautious optimism are real and growing. M-Pesa, the Kenyan mobile money platform, now processes over $314 billion in annual transactions; sub-Saharan Africa has more than 500 million mobile money accounts, more than any other region on Earth. Financial inclusion has leapfrogged the branch-banking model entirely. Nollywood is the world's second-largest film industry by volume of production. Rwanda, devastated by genocide in 1994, has achieved seven to eight per cent annual growth for two decades under Paul Kagame — corruption is low, infrastructure is functional, and foreign investment is rising. The African Continental Free Trade Area, which entered force in 2021, creates a single market of 1.4 billion people with a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion — the largest such agreement by number of participating countries anywhere in the world.

The optimistic scenario is East Asian transformation at continental scale: young, urbanising populations, mobile technology, intra-African trade, and the mineral wealth the green transition demands — cobalt, lithium, rare earths, platinum — all of which Africa possesses in abundance. The pessimistic scenario is humanitarian catastrophe: weak states overwhelmed by numbers, climate degrading farmland, youth unemployment fuelling insurgency — and the destabilising pressure of uncontrolled migration across the Mediterranean that benefits neither continent. Both scenarios will play out simultaneously across different parts of the continent — often within the same country. Nigeria, with its booming tech sector in Lagos and its Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast, embodies both possibilities in a single nation. The question is which predominates — and the answer will depend less on Africa itself than on whether the rest of the world engages with the continent as a serious economic partner or continues to treat it as a problem to be managed.

## The Window

Africa's demographic window will not stay open forever. Fertility rates are already falling in southern Africa and in urban centres across the continent — South Africa's rate has dropped to 2.3, Botswana's to 2.4, Kenya's urban rate below 3.0. The window of maximum demographic advantage — when the working-age population is at its largest proportion relative to dependants — will begin to narrow by mid-century. Every nation that has successfully converted a demographic dividend into durable prosperity — South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China — did so within a roughly thirty-year window. Those that missed it — much of Latin America in the 1980s, parts of Southeast Asia — found that the window closed and the dividend curdled into a liability. A large, young population without employment is not an asset; it is a source of instability, radicalisation, and the kind of desperation that fills the ranks of insurgencies — a catastrophe for Africa and a destabilising force for everyone else.

China understood this early. It invested in African infrastructure when the rest of the world was still sending aid workers and holding concerts. Europe and America, burdened by colonial guilt and strategic complacency, have been slowest to grasp the shift. The United States' Africa strategy has been largely reactive — counter-terrorism in the Sahel, humanitarian aid after crises — while China was building railways and ports. African nations do not need charity, and they do not need to export their young people to ageing Western economies. They need investment, trade, technology transfer, and to be treated as the economic and strategic partners they are rapidly becoming. The solution to Africa's youth bulge is African jobs — not European visas.

The median age in Niger is 15.6 years. Half the country has not yet finished school. That is not a crisis statistic. It is a statement about the future — about who will be working, consuming, trading, and voting in 2050 and beyond. The youngest continent on Earth is about to become the most consequential, and the only question is whether the rest of the world will be ready when it does. Send that to someone who still thinks Africa is a charity case.
