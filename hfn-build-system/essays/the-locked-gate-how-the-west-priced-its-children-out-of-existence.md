# The Locked Gate: How the West Priced Its Children Out of Existence

The average house in England now costs 8.9 times the average annual pre-tax salary. In London the ratio reaches 13.5. In Sydney it is 13.3; Vancouver 12.3; Hong Kong 16.7. A young couple in Seoul, saving every penny of both salaries, would need eighteen years to afford a modest flat — a period so long that by the time they moved in, any children they had hoped to raise there would be applying to university. For most of the twentieth century, a house in Britain cost between three and four times the average income. A single earner on a median wage could reasonably expect to buy a home, raise a family, and retire with something to leave behind. That world has vanished so completely that describing it to someone under thirty feels like recounting a fairy tale — one in which the prince not only gets the castle but can actually afford the mortgage.

The consequences are what any student of history would predict. Every city where housing costs have reached extreme levels has a fertility rate below 1.5 — well beneath the 2.1 replacement threshold required to maintain a stable population. Seoul recorded 0.72 in 2023, the lowest of any major country in recorded history. Hong Kong reported 0.77. Italy 1.20. England and Wales 1.49, the lowest since records began in 1938. The Romans would have found this familiar. Augustus tried to bribe citizens into having children with the *Lex Papia Poppaea* of AD 9 — tax penalties for the childless, inheritance rewards for the fertile. It worked about as well as modern baby bonuses, which is to say not at all. The Roman plebeians could not afford decent housing in the capital either.

Two thousand years of civilisational progress, and the fundamental complaint of the young remains stubbornly unchanged: they cannot afford a home, and the old cannot understand why they are making such a fuss. This is the story of how the West locked the gate to homeownership and, in doing so, priced its own children out of existence.

## The Enclosure of the Modern World

Between 1750 and 1850, the English Enclosure Acts transformed the landscape through some four thousand separate Acts of Parliament. Roughly 6.8 million acres of common land — one-fifth of England — were parcelled off and assigned to individual owners. The commoners who had farmed these strips for generations had no legal title and no recourse. E.P. Thompson described the process with characteristic precision: "a plain enough case of class robbery played according to the fair rules of property and law." Millions of displaced rural families were driven into the rapidly growing industrial cities, creating a landless urban proletariat and, with it, the modern housing crisis.

The Roman precedent is older and starker. In the late Republic, the *latifundia* — vast agricultural estates — concentrated in senatorial hands while the small farmers who had formed the backbone of Rome's citizen-soldier army were progressively dispossessed. The Gracchi brothers attempted land reform in the 130s and 120s BC, proposing to enforce existing limits on landholding and redistribute the surplus. Both were murdered by the very senators whose property they threatened to limit. The land remained concentrated. The dispossessed soldiers, with nothing to fight for, transferred their loyalty from the Republic to individual generals who promised them land in exchange for service. Within a century, the Republic had fallen.

The demographic historian John Hajnal identified the mechanism that connects land access to population in a landmark 1965 paper. West of the "Hajnal line" — an imaginary boundary running from Saint Petersburg to Trieste — European marriage was traditionally contingent on the couple's ability to establish an independent household. No house, no marriage. No marriage, no children. The system was distinctive to Western Europe and had persisted since at least the medieval period. It produced later marriage, smaller families, and a demographic pattern fundamentally different from the rest of the world.

The modern enclosure is accomplished with different tools — planning restrictions, buy-to-let portfolios, and a tax system that treats housing as an investment rather than a necessity — but the result is the same. Land concentrates. Access narrows. Birth rates fall. Hajnal's mechanism has not disappeared. It has intensified.

## Why Housing Became Unaffordable

The causes are multiple, interlocking, and mutually reinforcing.

**Restrictive planning.** Britain's 1947 Town and Country Planning Act and the Green Belt policy created an artificial scarcity of developable land that has persisted for nearly eighty years. The system gives existing residents an effective veto over new development — NIMBYism as a constitutional principle. San Francisco's median time to approve a new residential development exceeds four years. Tokyo, by contrast, operates under a national zoning code that strips local authorities of the power to block housing, and consequently builds prolifically and affordably.

**Cheap money.** Between 2009 and 2022, central banks in the US, Europe, Japan, and the UK held interest rates at historic lows — a policy designed to stimulate recovery from the financial crisis and then the pandemic. The primary side effect was the inflation of asset prices. UK house prices rose seventy-three per cent in nominal terms over this period while real wages grew approximately two per cent. The policy that was meant to help ordinary households recover from a recession transferred wealth, at extraordinary scale, from those who did not own assets to those who did.

**Financialisation.** Housing has been transformed from a place to live into a financial instrument. Buy-to-let mortgages, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investors now own vast portions of what was once owner-occupied housing stock. In England, the private rented sector grew from nine per cent of households in 1991 to nineteen per cent by 2021. Thomas Piketty's central insight in *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* applies with particular force to housing: when the return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth, wealth concentrates. Housing is the dominant form of capital in most Western economies, and its appreciation has outstripped wage growth for decades.

**Demographic pressure and immigration.** The UK population grew by nearly nine million between 1998 and 2023 — driven substantially by net immigration — while housebuilding consistently failed to keep pace. England built an average of roughly 170,000 new homes per year over this period; most estimates suggest 250,000 to 300,000 were needed. The gap between demand and supply is structural and has been widening for a generation, creating an affordability crisis that compounds year on year as the deficit accumulates.

**Failed intergenerational transfer.** Rising life expectancy and the escalating costs of elder care mean that the "Bank of Mum and Dad" — relied upon by a growing proportion of first-time buyers — is increasingly the Bank of Mum and Dad's Nursing Home. Danny Dorling has documented this squeeze: the wealth that previous generations expected to inherit in their thirties or forties now arrives, if it arrives at all, in their sixties.

Each cause reinforces the others in a self-perpetuating loop. Planning restrictions limit supply. Limited supply inflates prices. Inflated prices attract investors. Investors compete with first-time buyers. First-time buyers are priced out. The system functions precisely as designed — for the benefit of those who already own.

## The Demographic Mechanism

The link between housing costs and fertility is one of the most extensively documented relationships in modern demography. When young people cannot afford a home, they delay leaving the parental household. They delay forming a stable partnership. They delay establishing an independent household — the prerequisite, in the Western European marriage pattern, for starting a family. Each delay compresses the fertility window.

A 2023 YouGov poll found that forty-two per cent of UK adults aged twenty-five to thirty-four who wanted children but did not yet have them cited housing costs or housing insecurity as the principal reason for delay. In South Korea, seventy-three per cent of unmarried young adults identified housing costs as a "major or decisive factor" in their decision not to marry or have children. The mean age at first marriage in England and Wales rose from 24.6 for women in 1971 to 32.1 in 2020. In South Korea, women's mean age at first marriage reached 31.3 in 2022 — at the outer biological edge of comfortable conception. Marriage rates in England and Wales have fallen seventy-five per cent between 1972 and 2019.

The correlation across the OECD is stark: countries with the highest housing cost burdens have the lowest fertility rates. There are no exceptions worth mentioning. Japan, despite its reputation as a demographic cautionary tale, is instructive in a different way. Its fertility rate of 1.20, while low, is higher than South Korea's, Italy's, or Spain's. One reason is that Japan has kept housing relatively affordable by building at scale: Tokyo permitted more new housing starts in 2022 than the entire United Kingdom. Japanese zoning is set nationally, depriving local NIMBYs of their most effective weapon. The mechanism Hajnal described in 1965 — no independent household, no marriage, no children — has not disappeared. It has intensified under the weight of asset prices that would have been inconceivable to the generation that created the system. The Western European marriage pattern was adaptive when land access expanded and contracted with economic cycles. It becomes catastrophic when land access is permanently restricted by policy choices that benefit incumbent owners at the expense of every subsequent generation.

The generational dimension deserves emphasis. A British baby boomer who bought a house in 1985 for three times their salary now sits on an asset worth eight to ten times the average salary — a capital gain that dwarfs anything they earned through labour. Their children, entering the market forty years later, face prices that require two incomes, parental assistance, and mortgage terms that extend into their sixties. The wealth transfer is not from rich to poor or from one class to another. It is from young to old — from the generation that has not yet accumulated to the generation that accumulated effortlessly, simply by buying a house at the right time.

## Who Benefits — and the Gate Can Be Unlocked

Existing homeowners benefit directly. For most, their house is their single largest asset, and rising prices generate a sense of increasing wealth — even if the gain is largely illusory unless they downsize or emigrate. Landlords benefit from rising rents and capital appreciation; the number of buy-to-let mortgages in the UK grew from virtually zero in 1996 to 1.8 million by 2017. Banks benefit from larger mortgages on more expensive properties — UK mortgage debt stood at approximately £1.66 trillion in 2023. Governments benefit from stamp duty, capital gains tax, and council tax revenues; the UK collected £11.7 billion in stamp duty alone in 2022–23.

The parallel with pre-revolutionary France is uncomfortable but precise: a system that systematically transfers wealth from the asset-poor to the asset-rich, defended by those who profit from it and sustained by a political structure that gives the beneficiaries disproportionate voice. As Danny Dorling has noted with typically dry clarity: "The housing crisis is not a crisis for those who own houses."

The young, who bear the costs, are the least likely to vote and the least likely to own property. The old, who reap the benefits, are the most likely to vote and the most likely to own a home outright. The political incentives point precisely backwards. And until the political calculus changes — until the costs of demographic decline become more frightening to governments than the costs of falling house prices — the system will remain exactly as it is.

Solutions exist. They are not mysterious, merely politically inconvenient. Japan chose to build, and by centralising zoning authority it kept housing affordable despite extraordinary urbanisation. Vienna houses approximately sixty per cent of its residents in subsidised or municipal housing — the "Red Vienna" legacy of the 1920s — well-maintained and socially mixed. Singapore's Housing and Development Board accommodates roughly eighty per cent of residents on ninety-nine-year leases at subsidised prices, with priority access for married couples and families. The common thread is that each of these models required existing property owners to accept an uncomfortable truth: housing cannot simultaneously be affordable for the young and an ever-appreciating investment for the old. These two objectives are mathematically incompatible. Every percentage point of annual house price growth above wage growth is a percentage point of increased unaffordability for the next generation of buyers. House prices can rise, or birth rates can recover. They cannot both happen at once. Every Western government that has promised to solve the housing crisis while simultaneously promising to protect homeowner equity has been making a promise it cannot keep — and its voters, on both sides of the generational divide, know it.

The Romans never solved their housing crisis. The Gracchi's reforms were blocked by a senatorial class that preferred short-term wealth preservation to long-term social stability, and the Republic fell within a century of their murders. The West is not Rome, but the mechanism is identical. When a society prices its young out of housing, it prices them out of family formation and out of a future. The gate is locked, and the keys are in the pockets of those who have no incentive to turn them. Send that to anyone who still thinks the birth rate is a lifestyle choice.
