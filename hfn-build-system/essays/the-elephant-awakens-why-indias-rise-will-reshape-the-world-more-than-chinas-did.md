# The Elephant Awakens: Why India's Rise Will Reshape the World More Than China's Did

On 23 August 2023, India's Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft touched down on the lunar south pole — a region no other nation had reached. The mission cost approximately seventy-five million dollars. The Hollywood film *Gravity*, which depicted a fictional space disaster, cost one hundred million. India reached a place on the Moon that neither America, Russia, nor China had managed to land on, and did it for less than the price of Sandra Bullock pretending to float in zero gravity.

This is the contradiction that defines India and that the West consistently underestimates. A nation where two hundred million people still lack reliable electricity put a spacecraft where nobody else had landed. A country with more people in absolute poverty than the entire population of Western Europe runs the world's largest biometric identity system — Aadhaar, covering 1.4 billion people — exports more IT services than any other nation on Earth, and operates a digital payments infrastructure, UPI, that processed over 117 billion real-time transactions in 2024, more than the United States and Europe combined.

The British ruled India for two centuries and left behind cricket, railways, and the unshakeable assumption that India would always be a rather magnificent mess. Two out of three were reasonable assessments. The third is becoming embarrassingly wrong. The world spent thirty years fixated on China's rise — the factories, the skyscrapers, the high-speed rail. The more consequential story, the one that will reshape the global order more profoundly and more durably, was happening next door. India surpassed China as the world's most populous country in April 2023. Its economy is growing faster than any other major nation's. Its median age is twenty-eight. And unlike China, which achieved its transformation through one-party authoritarianism and state-directed investment, India is doing it as a chaotic, fractious, exasperating democracy — which, historically speaking, is rather the point.

## The Last Great Demographic Dividend

Every great power achieved its dominance when its population was young, growing, and urbanising. This is not a coincidence. It is a pattern as reliable as compound interest.

Britain's Industrial Revolution coincided with a population explosion from six million in 1750 to twenty-one million by 1850. The young workers flooding into Manchester and Birmingham powered the factories that powered the empire. America's rise was fuelled by waves of young immigrants — 33 million between 1820 and 1924 — who provided the labour for industrialisation at a scale the Old World could not match. China's economic miracle from 1980 to 2020 was powered by the largest working-age cohort in human history, unleashed by Deng Xiaoping's reforms into an export-manufacturing economy of extraordinary efficiency.

India's demographic dividend is only just beginning. Its median age in 2025 is 28.4 — younger than China at 39.6, the United States at 38.5, the EU at 44.4, Japan at 49.1, or South Korea at 44.5. India has approximately six hundred million people under the age of twenty-five. That is nearly twice the entire population of the United States — the largest cohort of young people any single country has ever possessed.

The contrast with China is stark and growing starker by the year. China's working-age population peaked in 2015 and has been declining since. The one-child policy, enforced from 1980 to 2015, achieved its goal of slowing population growth but created a demographic distortion that no subsequent policy reversal can fix. Beijing scrapped the one-child policy in 2015, introduced a two-child policy, then a three-child policy in 2021, then effectively removed all limits. It has not mattered. China's birth rate in 2023 was 6.39 per thousand — the lowest in its recorded history, lower even than Japan's. By 2050, China will have more people over sixty-five than the entire current population of Europe. Japan's experience is the cautionary precedent. In 1990, Japan was widely expected to overtake the United States economically. Its population aged, its workforce shrank, its property market collapsed, and it entered three decades of stagnation from which it has never fully recovered. Demographic decline is a slow-motion trap with no known escape.

India faces the opposite situation. Its dependency ratio — the proportion of non-working-age population to working-age — is falling and will not reach its minimum until approximately 2040. That gives India a fifteen-year window of maximum demographic advantage, when the workforce is at its largest proportion relative to dependants. Britain had this window from roughly 1780 to 1850. The United States had it from 1880 to 1960. China had it from 1985 to 2015. India's opened around 2010 and will not close until the mid-2040s. It is the last major demographic dividend on Earth.

## Five Thousand Years in Fast Forward

India is one of the oldest continuous civilisations on Earth, defined by recurring cycles of unity and fragmentation that are as much a feature of its history as the Ganges is of its geography.

The Maurya Empire under Ashoka, around 268 to 232 BC, unified most of the subcontinent and governed perhaps fifty million people — making it one of the largest states in the ancient world, contemporary with Rome and the Qin dynasty. The Gupta Empire, from roughly 320 to 550 AD, was India's "Golden Age" — the period that produced the concept of zero, the decimal system, and Sanskrit literature that influenced civilisations from Southeast Asia to the Islamic world. The Mughal Empire at its height under Aurangzeb governed roughly 150 million people and produced perhaps twenty-five per cent of global GDP — a larger share than either China or the Ottoman Empire at the time. The British Raj unified through extraction: railways built not to connect Indian cities to each other but to move resources to the ports and thence to Britain.

Independent India's achievement — the one that historians a century from now will recognise as its most consequential — was to unify the subcontinent through democracy. When India gained independence in August 1947, virtually no serious Western observer expected it to survive as a single country, let alone a functioning democracy. George Kennan, the architect of Cold War containment, dismissed it as "a mere geographic expression." The challenges were staggering: 500 princely states that had to be coaxed or coerced into joining; fourteen major languages; six major religions; a caste system of byzantine complexity; and eighty-five per cent illiteracy. India held its first general election in 1951–52: 173 million eligible voters participated in the largest democratic exercise in human history to that date, many of them voting with pictorial symbols because they could not read. It has held elections continuously since. Power has transferred peacefully dozens of times between parties that agree on almost nothing except the principle that power transfers peacefully.

The historical parallel is not China but the United States. America in the 1850s was riven by slavery, wracked by sectional violence, and dismissed by European statesmen as a vulgar experiment unlikely to survive its own contradictions. Alexis de Tocqueville predicted American greatness despite the chaos; his European contemporaries thought him naive. It was also the most economically dynamic society on Earth — building railways, absorbing immigrants, and generating wealth at a pace that bewildered the genteel economies of the Old World. The mess and the dynamism were not contradictions. Historically, they are the same thing. Order imposed from above produces compliance; order negotiated from below — messy, slow, infuriating — produces resilience. India is messy in the way that America in 1870 was messy: not in spite of its potential, but as a feature of the energy that drives it.

The digital transformation deserves particular attention, because it demonstrates what India can achieve when it gets out of its own way. UPI — the Unified Payments Interface — was launched in 2016 and within eight years had become the world's largest real-time digital payments system. In 2024 it processed over 117 billion transactions, dwarfing card-based systems in the West. Aadhaar, the biometric identity system, covers 1.4 billion people — a digital identity infrastructure that no other country has replicated at anything approaching this scale. India Stack — the combination of Aadhaar, UPI, and a digital documents layer — has enabled financial inclusion at a speed that would have taken decades through conventional banking. Nearly 500 million previously unbanked Indians now have access to formal financial services. This is not a developing country catching up. In digital public infrastructure, India is the global leader.

## Why India Is Not China — And Why That Matters

China's growth model was state-directed, export-led, and authoritarian. The state decided what to build, where to build it, and how much to spend. It worked spectacularly as a catch-up strategy: China laid more high-speed rail than the rest of the world combined, built cities from scratch, and lifted eight hundred million people out of poverty in four decades. But the model has structural limits. State-directed investment produced ghost cities and a property sector now deflating under over three trillion dollars of developer debt. The one-child policy created a demographic crisis. Authoritarian control — efficient for building infrastructure — is less efficient for the kind of bottom-up innovation that drives productivity growth once the easy gains of industrialisation are exhausted.

India's model is fundamentally different, and that difference may prove decisive. Its economy is consumption-driven, with domestic demand accounting for roughly sixty per cent of GDP — meaning it is less vulnerable to global trade shocks than China's export-dependent model. It is services-led: the IT sector alone employs over five million people directly — and many more indirectly — and generates $250 billion annually in exports. India produces more software engineers per year than any other country; its pharmaceutical industry manufactures over sixty per cent of the world's vaccines and a substantial share of global generic medicines. Growth happens despite the government, not because of it — India's private sector, particularly in technology, pharmaceuticals, and financial services, drives the economy while the state apparatus lumbers behind.

India will never build infrastructure as quickly as China did. Moving goods from a factory in Tamil Nadu to a port in Gujarat can take longer than shipping from Shanghai to Rotterdam — a logistics nightmare rooted in inadequate roads, fragmented regulation, and bureaucratic inertia that would have impressed the Mughal revenue administration. Bureaucracy is India's hereditary disease, and the thicket of permits, licences, and inspections remains formidable despite Modi's reforms.

The obstacles are real and serious. Water is potentially the most consequential: seventeen per cent of India's groundwater assessment units are classified as "over-exploited" by the Central Ground Water Board, and the Ganges basin alone supports five hundred million people. Communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims, and the persistence of caste-based discrimination, remain fault lines that any serious analysis of India must acknowledge.

But every rising power faced comparable obstacles — and overcame them. The United States in the 1870s had no national infrastructure to speak of, rampant corruption at every level of government, and racial apartheid in a third of its states. It became the world's largest economy by 1890. The obstacles were not decisive, because the underlying demographic and economic momentum was too powerful. India's sheer scale and demographic weight give it a margin for error that smaller nations lack. The question is not whether India will rise — that is mathematically near-certain — but whether it will rise fast enough and coherently enough to maximise its demographic window before it begins to narrow in the 2040s.

## The Swing State of the Century

India is already the most important swing state in global geopolitics — and it is playing the role with a sophistication that neither Washington nor Beijing fully appreciates.

India participates in the Quad — the security dialogue with the United States, Japan, and Australia that is, in all but name, an anti-China alliance. It is simultaneously a member of BRICS with China, Russia, and Brazil, and of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation alongside both China and Russia. It buys Russian oil at discounted prices — becoming Russia's largest crude customer since the Ukraine war — while purchasing American weapons systems and conducting joint naval exercises with the US Navy. Google's largest office outside the United States is in Hyderabad. Huawei's largest research centre outside China is in Bangalore. Both sides need India more than India needs either of them, and New Delhi knows it.

The Indian Ocean is the most strategically important body of water in the twenty-first century: forty per cent of global trade passes through the Strait of Malacca, within range of Indian naval power. The Persian Gulf, from which India imports eighty-five per cent of its oil, is an Indian strategic interest that no other power can secure on India's behalf. Geography, like demography, is not a policy choice. It is a constraint and an opportunity — and India's geography is magnificent.

The UN projects India's population at approximately 1.7 billion by 2050, peaking around 2065. India's fertility rate is already below replacement; it will not reach two billion and does not need to. What matters is age structure. In 2050, India will have approximately 1.05 billion people of working age — the largest workforce on the planet. China will have approximately 840 million, down from over one billion today. The European Union will have roughly 230 million. Japan perhaps fifty-five million.

India has perhaps twenty-five years remaining to convert its demographic dividend into durable economic and strategic weight. If it can sustain six to seven per cent annual growth through that window — achievable but not guaranteed — it will be the world's third-largest economy by 2030 and could challenge for second by 2050. Twenty-five years is not long — but it is enough. Britain industrialised in less. America became a superpower in less. The elephant is awakening. It would be unwise to assume it will go back to sleep. Send that to anyone who still thinks the twenty-first century is a two-horse race between America and China.
