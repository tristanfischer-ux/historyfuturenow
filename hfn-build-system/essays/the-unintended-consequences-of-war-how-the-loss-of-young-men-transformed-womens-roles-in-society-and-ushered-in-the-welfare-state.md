# The Unintended Consequences of War: How the Loss of Young Men Transformed Women's Roles in Society and ushered in the Welfare State

### Introduction

Throughout history, war has left an indelible mark on society, transforming the lives of those who survive and reshaping the roles of both men and women. While the devastating impact of conflict on the battlefield is well-documented, the true extent of war's influence on society, particularly in relation to the loss of young men and the subsequent changes in women's roles, is often overlooked.

In this article, History Future Now argues that the staggering loss of young male lives in major conflicts, spanning from the Thirty Years' War to World War II, has had far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the battlefield. These losses have forced women to step into roles traditionally occupied by men, both in the workplace and in the political arena, while also compelling the state to take on the responsibilities of the male provider.

As a result, the very fabric of society has been transformed, leading to the rise of the modern welfare state and a fundamental shift in the traditional roles of men and women. The impact of these changes are vast and complex, affecting everything from individual autonomy to the traditional family structure.

To support this thesis, we will analyse the impact of six major conflicts on the young male population and trace the cascading effects of these losses on women's roles and the state. By examining the interconnectedness of war, gender roles, and societal change, we aim to shed light on the unintended consequences of conflict and the uncertain future that lies ahead.

### Part 1: The Wars and Their Impact on Young Men

This first part of the argument really sets the scene. We will go through a number of conflicts over time to show the significantly larger loss of life by men over women during key conflicts and specifically the loss of young men. Losing such a large segment of your population creates a vacuum that needs to be filled, which we will discuss in Part 2.

The Thirty Years' War was a tragedy of unparalleled proportions in German history, leaving behind a shattered, depopulated, and impoverished country.

The Thirty Years' War was a conflict primarily fought in Central Europe, involving most of the European powers. The war began as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics within the Holy Roman Empire but evolved into a broader struggle for political power and territory. The conflict ended with the Peace of Westphalia, which redrew the political map of Europe and established the concept of state sovereignty.

The war resulted in an estimated 4 to 12 million deaths, with a significant portion being young men. Germany, which was the primary theater of the war, lost an estimated 20% to 40% of its population, with some regions losing up to 70% of their inhabitants. To put the scale of these losses into perspective, the total number of deaths in the Thirty Years' War is equivalent to 4 to 11 times the current population of Birmingham (1.1 million). Civilian casualties were also high, with widespread famine, disease, and violence affecting the population, but the impact on young men was significantly greater.

One example of the war's impact on a specific region is the city of Magdeburg, which was besieged and sacked by Imperial forces in 1631. The city, which had a pre-war population of around 25,000, was reduced to just 5,000 survivors, with a large portion of the dead being young men who had fought to defend the city.

The war, driven by religious and political rivalries, resulted in immense human suffering and economic ruin, with the effects felt for generations. The loss of such a significant portion of the young male population had long-lasting consequences. Many regions of Germany experienced severe population declines, with some areas not recovering their pre-war population levels until the 19th century. The shortage of young men led to a breakdown in social order, with increased crime, poverty, and the abandonment of agricultural land. The war also had a profound impact on the institution of marriage, with many women unable to find husbands due to the shortage of men.

The Napoleonic Wars were the first truly European conflict, involving armies of unprecedented size and causing destruction on an unparalleled scale.

The Napoleonic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between France, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, and various coalitions of European powers. The wars began with Napoleon's rise to power and his expansionist ambitions and ended with his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and subsequent exile. The conflicts resulted in significant changes to the political landscape of Europe.

The wars resulted in an estimated 3 to 7 million military deaths, with a male-to-female death ratio that heavily skewed towards men. France alone suffered up to 1.7 million military deaths, representing a significant portion of its young male population. The total number of military deaths in the Napoleonic Wars is equivalent to 6 times the current population of Birmingham. Civilian casualties were also high, with widespread destruction, famine, and disease affecting the populations of the involved nations, but the impact on young men was significantly greater.

The scale of the losses can be illustrated by the example of the Grande Armée, the main French army under Napoleon's command during the invasion of Russia in 1812. The Grande Armée initially consisted of around 685,000 men, but by the end of the campaign, only about 10,000 survived, with the vast majority of the dead being young men.

The loss of so many young men led to demographic shifts, economic challenges, and social changes in the affected nations. In France, the shortage of young men led to a decline in birth rates and a shift towards smaller families. The wars also had a significant impact on the economy, with many industries struggling to recover from the loss of skilled workers. The social upheaval caused by the wars contributed to the rise of new political movements and the spread of revolutionary ideas across Europe.

The Crimean War was a conflict that showed the world the horrors of modern warfare and the importance of medical care for soldiers.

The war was a conflict primarily fought between Russia and an alliance of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. The war began as a dispute over the control of holy sites in Jerusalem and escalated into a broader struggle for influence in the Black Sea region. The conflict ended with Russia's defeat and the reordering of the balance of power in Europe.

The war resulted in an estimated 336,000 to 623,000 male combat deaths, with a male-to-female combat death ratio of 3.5:1. The Russian Empire lost between 4 and 11% of its male population aged 18-30, while the Ottoman Empire lost up to 3.7%. Civilian casualties were relatively limited compared to later conflicts, but the war had a significant impact on local populations through displacement and economic disruption.

The loss of so many young men had demographic, economic, and social implications for the affected countries. In Russia, the war led to a significant decline in the male population, particularly in rural areas where many of the soldiers were recruited from. This demographic imbalance persisted for generations, affecting marriage patterns, family structures, and social norms. The war also had a significant impact on the Russian economy, with the loss of young men leading to labor shortages in agriculture and industry.

The American Civil War began with the secession of southern states from the Union and was fought primarily over the issue of slavery. The war ended with the defeat of the Confederacy and the abolition of slavery.

The conflict claimed an estimated 620,000 to 750,000 military lives, with a male-to-female combat death ratio of 11:1 for the Union and 6:1 for the Confederate States. The Confederate States experienced a higher percentage of male fighting-age deaths, with 18% to 20% of its male population aged 18-30 killed in combat, compared to the Union's 13%.

The impact of the war on specific communities can be seen in the example of the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The Battle of Gettysburg resulted in over 50,000 casualties, with a significant portion of the dead being young men from both the Union and Confederate armies.

The good news was that the war resulted in the preservation of the United States and the end of slavery. The bad news was that it came at a tremendous cost in young lives and left deep scars on American society. The war led to a significant decline in the male population in the Confederate states, with some areas losing up to a fifth of their men. This demographic imbalance had far-reaching consequences, affecting marriage rates, family structures, and gender roles. The war also had a devastating impact on the Southern economy, with the loss of slave labor and the destruction of infrastructure. The social and political upheaval caused by the war laid the groundwork for the civil rights struggles of the 20th century.

The First World War was a catastrophe for Europe, a cataclysm that destroyed a civilisation and set the stage for the even greater horrors of the Second World War.

World War I was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and quickly escalated into a global conflict. The war began as a complex web of alliances and nationalist fervour and soon devolved into a brutal stalemate characterised by trench warfare and unprecedented loss of life. The conflict ended with the defeat of the Central Powers and significant changes to the global political landscape.

The impact of the war on individual soldiers can be seen in the example of Wilfred Owen, a British poet who fought in the war and whose works, such as "Dulce et Decorum Est," vividly depicted the horrors of trench warfare. Owen was killed in action just one week before the war ended, his life cut short like so many other young men of his generation.

In France, the war led to a significant decline in the male population, with the country losing nearly 1.4 million men. This demographic imbalance had far-reaching effects on French society, with many women unable to find husbands and a significant decline in birth rates. The shortage of young men also had economic consequences, with labor shortages in key industries and a slow post-war recovery.

In Germany, the war's impact was even more severe. The country lost approximately 2 million men, representing a staggering 25% to 31% of its male population aged 18-30. This demographic catastrophe had profound consequences for German society, contributing to the rise of the "Lost Generation," a term used to describe the generation of young people who came of age during the war and struggled to find their place in the post-war world. The shortage of young men also had economic and social consequences, with labor shortages and a rise in alternative lifestyles, such as lesbianism and transgenderism, in the Weimar Republic. These lifestyles were highly subversive and the fight against proved a rallying cry for Hitler and his more conservative German followers.

In Russia, the war's impact was compounded by the country's social and political upheaval. The country lost an estimated 1.8 million men, representing 18.70% of its male population aged 18-30. The war's devastating toll on the Russian population, combined with widespread food shortages and political unrest, contributed to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917. Without the war it is highly likely that the revolution, had it even happened, would have been crushed by the army. The revolution led to the collapse of the Russian Empire, the horrors of the Red Terror and the establishment of the murderous Soviet Union which killed millions more of its own people, predominantly men.

World War II began with Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 and remains the deadliest conflict in human history. The war was fuelled by fascist aggression and expansionism and ended with the defeat of the Axis powers and significant changes to the global political landscape.

The conflict claimed an estimated 70-85 million lives, including both military and civilian casualties. The war resulted in an estimated 16-22 million male combat deaths, with a male-to-female combat death ratio of 16:1 in the Soviet Union, 30:1 in China, and 12.8:1 in Germany. To put the scale of these losses into perspective, the total number of male combat deaths in World War II is equivalent to 15 to 20 times the current population of Birmingham. Another way of visualising that number is that if all these men were standing shoulder to shoulder it would stretch to over 6,800 miles, which is about the distance from London to Vladivostok on Russia’s Pacific coast. The war's impact on young men was particularly severe, with the Soviet Union losing up to 49% of its male population aged 18-30, and Germany losing around 45%.

The impact of the war on individual cities can be seen in the example of Stalingrad, which was the site of one of the bloodiest battles in history. The Battle of Stalingrad resulted in an estimated 1.8 to 2 million casualties, with a significant portion of the dead being young Soviet men who defended the city against the German onslaught. The scale of the losses had a profound impact on the city and its population, with many families losing multiple generations of men.

It is worth highlighting that World War II also had a devastating impact on civilians, with an estimated 40-55 million civilian deaths. Women were particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, with an estimated 1.9-2.5 million rapes committed by enemy forces, affecting between 2% to 4% of the female population aged 18-30 in the Soviet Union and 2% to 4% in Germany. While these numbers are terrible and shocking, they are still significantly lower than the percentage of young men killed in combat.

The loss of so many young men had profound and long-lasting consequences for the countries involved. In the Soviet Union, the demographic imbalance caused by the war persisted for generations, with women outnumbering men well into the 1960s. This imbalance affected marriage patterns, family structures, and gender roles, with many women forced to take on traditionally male roles in the workforce and society.

In Germany, the war's aftermath saw a significant decline in the male population, with many young men killed, imprisoned, or forced to work as labourers in the post-war reconstruction effort. This shortage of men had far-reaching effects on German society, contributing to the advent of mass immigration, the rise of alternative lifestyles and the erosion of traditional gender norms. The war also had a profound impact on the global economy, with many countries struggling to rebuild in the face of massive destruction and the loss of a significant portion of their workforce.

### Part 2: The Impact of War on Women's Roles in Society and the Rise of the Welfare State

The loss of young men in conflicts, whether through death or prolonged absence, had a profound impact on the roles of women in society and the expansion of government support.

As husbands and fathers were killed or called away to serve for months or years at a time, women were forced to step into roles traditionally occupied by men in both the workplace and the political arena. They also had to take on more responsibility for decision-making within the family, which ultimately led to a desire for greater autonomy and political representation.

Simultaneously, the state began to fill the void left by the loss of male breadwinners, leading to the rise of the welfare state. This section will explore these changes in the context of each conflict.

The Thirty Years' War had a significant impact on the role of women in German society. With a substantial portion of the male population killed or away fighting, women were forced to take on new responsibilities both within the household and in the public sphere. Many women took over their husbands' businesses, such as blacksmithing, carpentry, and cobbling, ensuring the continuation of vital economic activities. Women also took on roles in agriculture, such as managing farms and livestock, which were essential for feeding their families and communities.

In some cases, women even took on roles in local government, such as managing the distribution of food and resources in their communities. For example, in the city of Nuremberg, women were appointed as "bread weighers" to ensure that bakers were not cheating their customers during times of scarcity.

To support women and children left behind, some German states began to provide limited assistance. In the city of Augsburg, for example, the government established a fund to provide financial support to widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the war. While these measures were not comprehensive, they represented an early recognition of the state's responsibility to support vulnerable populations.

The Napoleonic Wars had a similar impact on women's roles in French society. As men were conscripted into the military and sent away to fight, women were left to manage households, businesses, and farms. Women's participation in the workforce increased significantly during this period, particularly in the textile industry, where they made up the majority of workers in some factories. Women also took on roles in the production of war materials, such as making cartridges and sewing uniforms.

To support soldiers' families, the French government established the "Conseil de Famille" (Family Council) in 1806, which provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were killed or disabled in the war. The Council provided pensions to widows and orphans, as well as assistance with housing and education. This early form of state welfare was limited in scope but set a precedent for future government support programs.

The Crimean War is notable for the significant role played by women in nursing and medical care. Florence Nightingale, a British nurse, gained fame for her work in improving sanitary conditions and patient care in military hospitals. Her efforts helped to professionalize nursing and establish it as a respectable occupation for women.

To support the families of soldiers, the British government established the Royal Patriotic Fund in 1854. The Fund provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were killed or disabled in the war, including pensions for widows and grants for the education of orphans. The Fund was one of the first examples of a government-sponsored welfare program in Britain and set a precedent for future social support initiatives.

The American Civil War had a profound impact on the role of women in American society, particularly in the South. With a significant portion of the male population fighting in the war, women were forced to take on new roles in the household and the workforce. Many women worked in factories, particularly in the textile industry, producing uniforms, blankets, and other supplies for the war effort. Women also took on roles in agriculture, managing farms and plantations in the absence of their husbands.

In the North, women played a significant role in the abolitionist movement and in supporting the Union war effort. Women formed local soldiers' aid societies, which provided food, clothing, and medical supplies to Union soldiers. They also worked as nurses in military hospitals and on the front lines.

To support soldiers and their families, the US government established the Pension Bureau in 1862. The Bureau provided pensions to disabled soldiers and the widows and orphans of soldiers who died in the war. By 1894, the Bureau was providing pensions to nearly one million Civil War veterans and their families, making it one of the largest government programs in US history.

World War I had a profound impact on women's roles in society, as the scale of the conflict and the mass mobilization of men led to a significant increase in women's participation in the workforce. In Britain, for example, women took on roles in munitions factories, producing shells, bullets, and other war materials. Women also worked in transportation, as bus and tram conductors, and in agriculture, helping to feed the nation.

To support soldiers and their families, the British government introduced the Separation Allowance in 1914, which provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were serving in the war. The government also introduced the War Widows' Pension in 1916, which provided pensions to the widows of soldiers who died in the war. These programs were significant steps towards the development of a comprehensive welfare state in Britain.

In Germany, the government introduced the National Pension Law in 1920, which provided pensions to war widows and orphans. The law recognised the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families and the government's responsibility to support them.

The increased responsibility and decision-making power that women gained during the war led to a growing desire for greater political representation and autonomy. In many countries, women's suffrage movements gained momentum in the aftermath of the war, as women demanded the right to vote and participate in the political process. In Britain, for example, women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote in 1918, in recognition of their contributions to the war effort.

World War II had a similar impact on women's roles in society, as the mass mobilisation of men led to a significant increase in women's participation in the workforce. In the United States, women took on roles in factories, producing aircraft, ships, and other war materials. The iconic image of "Rosie the Riveter" came to symbolise the millions of American women who entered the industrial workforce to support the war effort. Women's participation in the U.S. labor force increased from 27% to 37% during the war years, marking a significant shift in gender roles and expectations.

Women also served in the military during World War II, with over 350,000 women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces alone. Women took on roles such as nurses, administrators, and pilots, challenging traditional notions of women's capabilities and roles in society.

The war also saw women making significant contributions in the realms of science and technology. Women like Hedy Lamarr, a Hollywood actress and inventor, co-invented a frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication system that laid the foundation for modern wireless technology. The many women who worked as codebreakers at Bletchley Park in England, including mathematician Alan Turing's team, played a crucial role in deciphering German codes and contributed to the Allied victory.

The prolonged absence of men during the war led to changes in family dynamics and gender roles. Women took on greater responsibility for decision-making and the management of household affairs, as well as the primary responsibility for raising children. Women had to make important decisions about the allocation of resources, the education of their children, and the care of elderly relatives, which gave them a greater sense of autonomy and control over their lives.

To support soldiers and their families, the US government passed the Servicemen's Dependents Allowance Act in 1942, which provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were serving in the war. The government also passed the G.I. Bill in 1944, which provided education and training benefits to veterans, as well as low-interest loans for housing and business start-ups.

In Britain, the government passed the Family Allowances Act in 1945, which provided financial assistance to families with children. The Act was part of a broader package of social reforms introduced by the Labour government after the war, which included the establishment of the National Health Service and the expansion of the welfare state.

The increased responsibility and decision-making power that women gained during the war led to a growing desire for greater political representation and autonomy. In many countries, women's rights movements gained momentum in the aftermath of the war, as women demanded greater equality in the workplace, in education, and in politics. In the United States, for example, the Women's Rights Movement of the 1960s and 1970s built on the foundations laid by women's experiences during World War II, leading to significant advances in women's rights and opportunities.

The expansion of government support programs during World War II set the stage for the development of comprehensive welfare states in many Western countries in the post-war period. These programs recognised the government's responsibility to support its citizens and provide a safety net for those in need.

The impact of war on women's roles in society and the expansion of government support programs was a gradual process that spanned centuries. Each conflict, from the Thirty Years' War to World War II, brought new challenges and opportunities for women, as they were forced to step into roles traditionally occupied by men, both in the short term due to prolonged absences and in the long term due to the loss of life.

Women took on roles in industry, agriculture, and the military, as well as in the household and the community. They became breadwinners, decision-makers, and leaders in their own right, challenging traditional gender roles and laying the groundwork for future advances in women's rights and opportunities. Women also made significant contributions in the fields of science, technology, and innovation, demonstrating their capabilities and challenging stereotypes about women's roles in society.

Finally, it is worth emphasising that World War 1 and World War 2 were total wars that were very close together in time and thus in cumulative impact. It is more helpful to think of them as one continuous war that was interspersed with periods of social unrest, ranging from the Great Depression to extended civil wars in much of Europe. Society never had a chance to recover.  By the time these wars were over citizens in the West were used to the government telling them what to do and to provide for them in ways that had never existed before.

### Part 3: Women stepping out of the home and the government stepping in

The evidence presented by History Future Now in Part 1 demonstrates the staggering loss of young men's lives across various conflicts spanning centuries. Part 2 illustrated the profound consequences of this loss on society, as women were forced to adapt and take on new roles and responsibilities in the aftermath of each war.

The vacuum left by the absence of husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons had far-reaching implications that transformed the fabric of society over time. Women stepped into the roles of men in the workplace and political arena, and the state took on the responsibilities of the husband and father. This is what we will turn to next, in Part 3.

One of the most significant changes brought about by the loss of young men in conflicts was the increased participation of women in the workforce. As the shortage of male labourers became more acute, women were compelled to fill the void, taking on roles that had traditionally been occupied by men. This shift challenged long-standing gender norms and gave women greater economic autonomy. The pattern of women entering the workforce in unprecedented numbers was consistently observed across multiple conflicts, from the Thirty Years' War to World War II. Over time, the cumulative effect of this change led to a profound transformation in the perception of women's roles in society and a gradual erosion of the traditional male-dominated workforce.

The political landscape was transformed as women, who had taken on more responsibilities and leadership roles in the absence of men, began to demand greater rights and representation. The women's suffrage movement, which had been gaining momentum prior to many of the conflicts discussed, was further fuelled by the experiences and needs of women during and after these wars. Women's increased participation in the political arena can be seen as another instance of women stepping into roles traditionally occupied by men. The cumulative effect of women's increased political participation and the challenges to traditional power structures brought about by the loss of young men in conflicts led to significant shifts in the balance of power and the rise of new political movements.

As women took on more responsibilities in the workforce, the state also began to fill the vacuum left by the loss of male breadwinners. Governments expanded support programs to assist war widows and their families, effectively taking on the role of the husband and father by providing financial assistance and social support.

Support for war widows eventually morphed into support for single mothers. This growth of the welfare state represented a significant shift in the relationship between citizens and their governments, as the state increasingly assumed the responsibilities previously held by male providers. The cumulative impact of these changes over time led to a greater dependence on the state for basic needs, raising questions about individual autonomy and social cohesion.

As women stepped outside the home and into the paid workforce, the state began to step in to provide support for children and families. The establishment of nursery care, preschools, and before- and after-school clubs became increasingly common in the post-war period, particularly in countries with high levels of female employment.

In many European countries, governments began providing subsidised childcare as part of efforts to promote gender equality and support women's participation in the workforce. The expansion of state-funded education and childcare services can be seen as a direct response to the changing roles of women in society, with the state taking on some of the traditional responsibilities of the mother in order to facilitate women's increased participation in the workforce and public life.

As the state took on a greater role in providing support for families and individuals, the concept of the "nanny state" began to emerge. This term refers to a government that takes an overprotective or excessively interfering approach to its citizens' lives, often through regulations and policies aimed at promoting health, safety, and well-being.

Examples of nanny state policies might include mandatory vaccination programs, regulations on food and drink (such as sugar taxes or bans on trans fats), or laws requiring the use of bicycle helmets or seatbelts. The provision and increased expectation that the government will provide free school meals to primary and secondary school children is another sign of the government stepping into the role of the parent.

While these policies are often well-intentioned, they have also been criticised for infringing on personal freedoms and individual responsibility. The rise of the nanny state can be seen as a natural extension of the state's increasing role as a surrogate parent and provider in the wake of the societal upheavals brought about by war and the changing roles of women.

Fathers have traditionally been associated with providing discipline at home. When children misbehaved, mothers could threaten them with the thought of being punished when father came home. However, the absence of fathers, or the abdication of responsibility by fathers who are present, has led to a significant decline in paternal discipline.

This breakdown in discipline is having serious consequences for society. According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, the percentage of public school teachers who reported that student misbehaviour interfered with their teaching increased from 36 percent in 1987-88 to 43 percent in 2011-12. Furthermore, a 2019 report by the National Association of Elementary School Principals found that 68 percent of principals reported an increase in disruptive student behaviour over the past five years.

The decline in paternal discipline, combined with the increasing emphasis on compassion over discipline in schools as more women enter the teaching profession, is exacerbating this problem. This lack of discipline in childhood is now extending into adulthood, contributing to a rise in anti-social behaviour, crime, and a general lack of respect for authority.

The increased participation of women in the workforce and political sphere has been accompanied by a shift towards more compassionate and nurturing approaches in these domains. As women have taken on leadership roles in business and government, they have often brought with them a greater emphasis on empathy and collaboration.

This shift can be seen in the rise of corporate social responsibility programs, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and family-friendly workplace policies. In the political sphere, women have been at the forefront of efforts to address issues like child welfare, support for refugees and immigrants, education, and healthcare, bringing a more nurturing and compassionate perspective to these debates.

The increased compassion in work and political life can be seen as a reflection of the traditional nurturing role of women in the family being transferred to the public sphere, as women have taken on more prominent roles in these domains.

In addition to the increased participation of women in the workforce, governments also turned to mass immigration as a means of replacing the lost male population. This influx of immigrant men helped to fill the labor shortages caused by the wars and played a significant role in reshaping the demographic and cultural landscape of many countries.

The demographic shifts and changing family structures resulting from the loss of young men in conflicts, combined with the influx of immigrants, led to significant changes in the traditional family structure and a greater diversity in relationships.

As women were increasingly drawn into the workforce, the question of who would take on the traditional roles of women in the household became more pressing. The answer, in part, came in the form of labor-saving devices and technological advancements that reduced the burden of housework.

The introduction of appliances like washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators in the early to mid-20th century significantly reduced the time and effort required for household chores. These technological advancements, coupled with the rise of convenience foods and ready-made clothing, made it easier for women to balance work and home life, effectively replacing some of the traditional roles of the mother in the household.

The widespread availability of birth control in the mid-20th century had a profound impact on women's lives and the structure of the family. The ability to control fertility gave women greater autonomy over their bodies and their life choices, allowing them to delay marriage and childbearing in order to pursue education and career opportunities.

The use of birth control also led to a significant decrease in family size in many developed countries. This shift towards smaller families had significant implications for women's roles and the allocation of household responsibilities. With fewer children to care for, women were able to devote more time and energy to their careers and personal pursuits, further challenging traditional gender roles and expectations.

The decreased emphasis on the family as the central unit of society can be seen as both a cause and a consequence of the changing roles of women in the wake of war and societal upheaval. As women gained more independence and opportunities outside the home, the traditional family structure began to lose its primacy, leading to a de-emphasis on family life and a greater focus on individual fulfilment.

As women and society as a whole became increasingly reliant on government support, it became more difficult for citizens to hold their governments accountable. This growing dependence on the state has the potential to undermine the democratic process, as people were less willing to challenge or criticise a government upon which they rely for their basic needs. Furthermore, the state's increasing role as a surrogate husband and father raises concerns about individual autonomy, as citizens may become more dependent on the state for their well-being and decision-making.

This has helped move political parties increasingly to the left. The more support they offer, the more people vote for them. Unfortunately, this largess cannot be funded by taxation alone, which explains the significant amount of national debt accumulated by most Western countries since the end of World War 2.

( A big parenthesis here: It is important to note that the societal changes described above may not have affected all countries in the same way. In Muslim countries, for example, the practice of polygamy and the cultural tradition of marrying the widows of deceased relatives may have helped to mitigate some of the demographic and social consequences of the loss of young men in conflicts. As a result, these societies may have been able to maintain, or even enhance, a more traditional family structure and gender roles in the face of war-induced population losses. Is this hypothesis true? This is something worth pursuing in another History Future Now article.)

The consequences of the loss of young men in conflicts, as evidenced in Parts 1 and 2, necessitated women stepping into the roles of men in the workplace and political arena, while the state took on the responsibilities of the husband and father.

### Part 4: Conclusion- The Unintended Consequences of War and an Uncertain Future

Large scale wars don’t just cause the death of millions of people. They don’t just cause terrible suffering and pain. They don’t just cause the destruction of families and communities. They don’t just cause the destruction of centuries worth of art and architecture. Those are just the short term impacts.

As this article has shown, large scale conflicts fundamentally alter the fabric of society. They have forced women to step into roles traditionally occupied by men and this, in turn, has led to the rise of the state as a surrogate husband and father.

Some will celebrate this. Death to the patriarchy!

However, as women entered the workforce and political arena, the state expanded its reach, providing support and assistance to families and individuals through welfare programs, education, and healthcare. This shift in the balance of power between the sexes and the growing dependence on the state had significant implications for individual autonomy and the traditional family structure.

As women have taken on more traditionally masculine roles, the state has also begun to encroach upon the remaining spaces traditionally occupied by women, particularly in the domestic sphere. The rise of the nanny state, with its increasing involvement in child-rearing, nutrition, and personal health decisions, has led to a further erosion of the traditional family structure and the roles of both men and women within it.

Moreover, the rapid advancement of technology, including in the form of artificial intelligence and robotics, is now threatening to displace both men and women from their traditional roles in the workplace. As machines become increasingly capable of performing tasks previously done by human workers, the question of what role individuals will play in society becomes ever more pressing. What is their role if the government is now both husband and wife, mother and father, and there is no work to be done?

The cumulative effect of these transformations has been a profound sense of unease and uncertainty, as the traditional pillars of society – the family, gender roles, and work – are increasingly called into question. We all can feel that there is something wrong. Life does not seem to make sense anymore.

As we grapple with the challenges posed by these societal shifts, it is essential that we recognise the interconnectedness of war, gender roles, technology, and the state. The lessons of history, as illuminated by the analysis of History Future Now, serve as a stark reminder of the unintended consequences that can arise from the upheaval caused by war and the changing roles of men and women in society.
