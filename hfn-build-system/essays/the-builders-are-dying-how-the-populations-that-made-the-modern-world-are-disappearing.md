# The Builders Are Dying: How the Populations That Made the Modern World Are Disappearing — And What Happens Next

In the winter of 2024, the last primary school in Albinen, a village in the Swiss Alps, closed its doors. Not because of funding. Because there were no children. The commune had tried everything — offering families 25,000 Swiss francs per child to move there, renovating the schoolhouse, advertising on social media. Nobody came. Albinen is not unusual. Across Germany, over 200 primary schools closed between 2020 and 2024 (Federal Statistical Office of Germany, 2024). In South Korea, 3,800 schools stand at less than half capacity (Korean Educational Development Institute, 2024). In rural Japan, entire school districts have been consolidated into single buildings, with children bussed in from depopulated villages where the median resident is over seventy.

Meanwhile, six thousand miles to the east, a Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou — the one that assembles most of the world's iPhones — is replacing production lines with robotic arms. Not because robots are fashionable, but because there are no longer enough young Chinese workers willing to do the job. China's working-age population has been shrinking since 2012 (China National Bureau of Statistics, 2023). The factory that once employed 300,000 people at peak production is quietly automating its way through a labour force that no longer exists.

Between them, Europeans and East Asians invented practically everything you are using to read this sentence — the semiconductor, the internet protocol, the LCD screen, the alphabet, the printing press, and quite possibly the chair you are sitting in. They are also, collectively, going extinct. Which presents a rather significant problem for everyone else.

This article is not a lament. It is an inventory, a set of projections, and an uncomfortable question. The inventory catalogues what two civilisational traditions built. The projections show that the populations behind those traditions are disappearing at a speed without historical precedent. And the question — the one that polite society prefers not to ask — is simple: who maintains the world after the builders are gone?

## The European Ledger

Any honest accounting of who built the modern world must begin with Europe, not because Europeans are inherently superior — this site has argued at length that the rise of the West was based substantially on luck (HFN, "The Rise of the West Was Based on Luck. That Has Run Out.") — but because the factual record is overwhelming and pretending otherwise helps nobody.

Between 1500 and 1950, European and European-diaspora populations produced approximately 97% of all significant scientific and technological accomplishments catalogued by historians of science (Murray, *Human Accomplishment*, 2003). That figure is not a boast. It is a consequence of geography, timing, institutional development, and, crucially, the compounding nature of knowledge. Once the scientific method was formalised in the seventeenth century — itself a European development, building on earlier Islamic and Greek foundations — the acceleration became self-reinforcing.

Consider the inventory. The scientific revolution: Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Kepler — all European. The germ theory of disease: Pasteur (French) and Koch (German). Antibiotics: Fleming (Scottish). Vaccination: Jenner (English). Anaesthesia: Morton (American of English descent). The periodic table: Mendeleev (Russian). Electricity and electromagnetism: Faraday, Maxwell, Tesla, Edison — European and European-diaspora. Nuclear physics: Rutherford (New Zealander of British descent), Bohr (Danish), Fermi (Italian), Einstein (German). The theory of evolution: Darwin (English). Genetics: Mendel (Austrian). The double helix: Watson (American) and Crick (English), building on Rosalind Franklin's (English) X-ray crystallography.

The institutional innovations are equally consequential and arguably more durable. Constitutional democracy, the independent judiciary, the separation of powers, the university system, patent law, double-entry bookkeeping, central banking, limited liability corporations, the scientific journal, the hospital, the public health system — all European in origin (Ferguson, *Civilisation*, 2011; Mokyr, *The Gifts of Athena*, 2002). These are not cultural ornaments. They are the operating system of the modern world.

The physical infrastructure follows the same pattern. The global shipping network was designed and built by European maritime powers. Aviation — the Wright brothers (American), jet engines — Frank Whittle (English) and Hans von Ohain (German). Telecommunications: from Morse's telegraph to Berners-Lee's World Wide Web, the entire chain is European and European-diaspora. The electrical grid architecture that powers virtually every city on Earth descends from designs pioneered in Europe and North America in the late nineteenth century.

Even today, the legacy is visible in the data. Europeans and European-diaspora populations have won approximately 85% of all Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, and medicine (Nobel Prize Committee, cumulative data through 2024). The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Switzerland — all European-heritage majority nations — account for the majority of the world's foundational research output and top-ranked universities (Shanghai Academic Ranking, 2024).

None of this happened in a vacuum. European science built on Islamic algebra and optics. European navigation used Chinese compasses and gunpowder. The Renaissance was partly sparked by the rediscovery of Greek texts preserved by Arab scholars. History Future Now has argued repeatedly that the West's rise was as much about luck and geography as about any inherent quality. But the fact remains: the system that now sustains eight billion people — its medicine, its agriculture, its energy, its communications — was overwhelmingly designed and built by people of European heritage. That population is now disappearing.

## The East Asian Ledger

The second pillar of the modern world is East Asian — principally Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. If Europe built the operating system, East Asia increasingly builds the hardware.

The historical record is formidable. Paper, invented by Cai Lun around 105 AD, made the transmission of knowledge possible (Needham, *Science and Civilisation in China*, Vol. 5). Woodblock printing, developed in China around 700 AD, preceded Gutenberg by seven centuries. Movable type, invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 AD, was a Chinese innovation that Gutenberg independently reinvented four hundred years later. Gunpowder, the magnetic compass, silk production, porcelain, the civil service examination system, canal lock engineering, blast furnace iron smelting — all Chinese (Needham, 1954–2008). For most of recorded history, China was the most technologically advanced civilisation on Earth.

The Great Divergence — the question of why China did not industrialise first despite having many of the prerequisites — has occupied historians for decades (Pomeranz, *The Great Divergence*, 2000). The answer involves coal geography, Atlantic trade, institutional path dependencies, and the centralising tendencies of the Qing state. It does not involve a lack of capacity. When East Asian societies decided to industrialise, they did so with a speed and thoroughness that stunned the West.

Japan's transformation is the most dramatic. Forced open by Commodore Perry's gunboats in 1853, Japan went from a feudal agrarian society to a major industrial power within forty years. By 1905, it defeated Russia in a full-scale war — the first non-European power to defeat a European power in modern history. The post-war economic miracle produced the world's second-largest economy, the Shinkansen bullet train (1964, still the global benchmark for high-speed rail), and Japanese dominance in automotive engineering, robotics, and consumer electronics that lasted decades (Vogel, *Japan as Number One*, 1979).

South Korea's trajectory is, if anything, more astonishing. In 1953, at the end of the Korean War, South Korea's GDP per capita was lower than Ghana's (World Bank, historical data). Seventy years later, it is the world's tenth-largest economy, home to Samsung and SK Hynix (which together produce over 60% of the world's memory chips), Hyundai, and a cultural export machine that has made Korean pop culture a global force (World Bank, 2024).

China's contemporary dominance in manufacturing is without historical parallel. China produces approximately 30% of all global manufacturing output (World Bank, 2024). It dominates solar panel production (~80% of global output), electric vehicle manufacturing (~60%), lithium-ion battery production (~75%), and rare earth processing (~90%) (BloombergNEF, 2024; IEA, 2024). Taiwan's TSMC manufactures approximately 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors — the single most critical choke point in the global technology supply chain (TSMC Annual Report, 2024). China now publishes more scientific papers annually than any other nation (Nature Index, 2024), and Japan and South Korea remain among the top ten global patent filers (WIPO, 2024).

Together, European-heritage and East Asian populations designed, built, and currently operate the overwhelming majority of the world's scientific, technological, industrial, and institutional infrastructure. The power stations, the semiconductor fabrication plants, the pharmaceutical laboratories, the fibre-optic networks, the water treatment facilities, the aircraft, the hospitals, the universities — virtually all of it traces its origins and ongoing operation to these two civilisational traditions.

Both are now dying.

## The Arithmetic of Extinction

The word "extinction" is not hyperbole. It is mathematics.

For a population to sustain itself, women must bear an average of 2.1 children — one to replace the mother, one the father, and a fraction to account for mortality before reproductive age. Every European nation and every East Asian nation is below this line. Most are far below it.



In Europe, the figures are uniformly bleak. Italy: 1.24. Spain: 1.19. Greece: 1.30. Germany: 1.35. Poland: 1.29. The United Kingdom: 1.49. France, long the continent's fertility champion thanks to generous family policies, has dropped to 1.68 and is falling (Eurostat, 2024). Not a single European country is at replacement level. Eastern Europe is emptying through a double blow: low births compounded by mass emigration of the young to the West.

In East Asia, the collapse is even more extreme. South Korea's total fertility rate of 0.72 is the lowest ever recorded by any nation in human history (Statistics Korea, 2024). Taiwan: 0.87. China: 1.02, with several provinces reporting rates below 0.8 (China NBS, 2024). Japan: 1.20 (Japan MHLW, 2024). Hong Kong: 0.77. Singapore: 0.97.



The population projections that follow from these numbers are not speculative. They are arithmetic. A fertility rate of 1.0 means each generation is half the size of the one before. South Korea's current rate of 0.72 means each generation is roughly a third of the previous one. The UN Population Division's median variant projects that China's population will fall from 1.4 billion today to approximately 800 million by 2100 — a loss of 600 million people, equivalent to the entire population of Europe (UN Population Division, *World Population Prospects 2024*). Japan will fall from 125 million to roughly 75 million. South Korea, from 52 million to perhaps 24 million.

Europe's trajectory is slower but equally irreversible. The continent's population is projected to fall from approximately 450 million to 350 million by 2100 (UN, 2024). But the working-age population will fall faster, as the proportion of elderly rises. The median age in Europe is already 44.4, compared to 19.7 in sub-Saharan Africa (UN, 2024).

The ethnic European share of global population tells the story most starkly. In 1900, people of European heritage constituted roughly 25% of the world's population. By 1950, it was approximately 22%. Today it is around 9%. By 2100, on current trajectories, it will be approximately 5% (UN Population Division, 2024; Maddison Project, 2020). East Asian populations are on a similar trajectory, delayed by a generation but falling faster.



No country in history has reversed a sustained fertility rate below 1.5 (Lutz et al., "The Low-Fertility Trap Hypothesis," *Vienna Yearbook of Population Research*, 2006). Augustus tried tax incentives in 18 BC. They failed. Singapore has spent billions on baby bonuses since the 1980s. Its fertility rate is 0.97. Hungary, which has implemented the most aggressive pro-natalist policies in Europe — income tax exemptions for mothers of four, subsidised housing, free IVF — has nudged its rate from 1.23 to 1.52 (Hungarian Central Statistical Office, 2024). Heroic effort. Still half a child short of survival.

The builders are dying. The question is what happens to what they built.

## Who Maintains the World? The Post-Colonial Evidence

This is where the conversation becomes uncomfortable. It is also where the evidence is most instructive.

When European colonial powers withdrew from Africa and Asia in the decades following the Second World War, they left behind physical and institutional infrastructure: railway networks, ports, power stations, hospitals, universities, legal codes, parliamentary systems, civil services. The question of whether these systems could be maintained and developed by the populations that inherited them is not theoretical. We have seventy years of data.

The broad pattern across sub-Saharan Africa is one of institutional and infrastructural decay. This is not a controversial claim — it is documented extensively by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, Freedom House, and Transparency International, among others. Africa's total railway network has *shrunk* since independence, with many colonial-era lines abandoned or inoperable (African Development Bank, *Africa Infrastructure Report*, 2023). Freedom House's democracy index shows persistent democratic backsliding across the continent, with only a handful of stable democracies (Freedom House, *Freedom in the World*, 2024). Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index consistently ranks the majority of sub-Saharan African nations in the bottom quartile globally (Transparency International, 2024).

Before proceeding, a caveat that is not merely rhetorical but analytically essential. Colonial rule was extractive by design. Infrastructure was built to move resources from the interior to the coast for export, not to develop integrated national economies (Acemoglu & Robinson, *Why Nations Fail*, 2012). Cold War interference — from CIA-backed coups to Soviet proxy wars — destabilised governments across the continent. Structural adjustment programmes imposed by the IMF and World Bank in the 1980s and 1990s gutted public services. Unfavourable trade terms persisted long after formal independence. The resource curse distorted economies. Debt traps compounded the problem. To attribute post-colonial decay solely to the characteristics of the inheriting populations would be historically illiterate.

And yet, the caveat does not explain everything. Because the most instructive case study is not a poor country crippled by extraction. It is the richest and most industrialised nation on the continent: South Africa.



In 1994, when Nelson Mandela took office, South Africa possessed the most sophisticated economy in Africa. Its financial system was world-class. Its mining sector was the most advanced on the continent. Eskom, the state electricity utility, provided reliable power to a national grid with surplus capacity. The road and rail networks functioned. The universities were internationally ranked. The country possessed nuclear technology, a functioning judiciary, a free press, and a per capita GDP that placed it firmly in the upper-middle-income category (World Bank, 1994).

Thirty years later, the ledger reads differently. Eskom — once a model utility — has subjected the country to rolling blackouts (euphemistically called "load-shedding") for over a decade, with 2023 seeing more than 300 days of power cuts (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, 2023). The root causes are documented: catastrophic maintenance backlogs, a shortage of skilled engineers, endemic corruption, and the failure to build new generation capacity in time (Eskom Annual Reports, 2015–2024).

Transnet, the state freight rail operator, has seen volumes collapse by approximately 40% between 2015 and 2024, crippling the mining sector's ability to export (Transnet Annual Reports). Signal cable theft is so endemic that entire lines have been rendered inoperable. The locomotive fleet has decayed. South African Airways, once a profitable national carrier, went bankrupt and required multiple government bailouts (National Treasury, South Africa).

Multiple municipalities can no longer maintain water treatment systems. Cholera outbreaks — a disease that has been controllable with basic sanitation since the nineteenth century — returned in 2023 (WHO, 2023). Unemployment stands at approximately 33% on the official measure and 42% on the expanded definition that includes discouraged workers (Stats SA, 2024). GDP per capita, in constant dollars, has declined since 2011 (World Bank, 2024).



The skills flight is quantifiable. The Institute of Race Relations estimates that between 800,000 and one million skilled South Africans — disproportionately white — have emigrated since 1994 (IRR, *South Africa Survey*, 2023). These were, in many cases, the engineers, doctors, managers, and technicians who operated the systems. They were not replaced at sufficient scale.

Zimbabwe amplifies the pattern. Once the "breadbasket of Africa," with a productive commercial farming sector, Zimbabwe became a net food importer within a decade of the land reform programme that seized white-owned farms and redistributed them to politically connected individuals with little farming expertise (Meredith, *The State of Africa*, 2005). Hyperinflation, institutional collapse, and infrastructural decay followed.

The pattern is not unique to Africa. The Roman parallel is precisely analogous — and it involves Europeans inheriting from Europeans, which strips the racial dimension away entirely. When the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the fifth century, the Germanic peoples who inherited its territory — Franks, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Vandals — were unable to maintain the infrastructure they acquired. The aqueducts fell into disrepair within a generation. The road network deteriorated. Literacy rates collapsed. Public sanitation disappeared. The population of Rome itself fell from over a million to fewer than 30,000 (Ward-Perkins, *The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilisation*, 2005). The knowledge to build aqueducts, maintain sewage systems, and produce high-quality pottery was lost for centuries. It was not a question of race. The Germanic tribes were European. It was a question of human capital — of whether the inheriting population possessed the institutional knowledge and technical skills to operate the systems they had acquired.

The lesson is civilisational, not racial: complex systems require the specific human capital that built them. When that human capital disappears — whether through emigration, demographic collapse, or civilisational discontinuity — the systems decay. They do not maintain themselves.

## The AI Question: Can Machines Replace the Builders?

If the populations that built the modern world are disappearing, and the evidence suggests that complex systems do not survive the departure of the human capital that created them, then the obvious question is whether artificial intelligence and robotics can serve as a substitute. Can the machines maintain what the humans no longer can?

The optimistic case is powerful. As this site has explored in "The Robot Bargain," AI and robotics are advancing at a pace that may allow them to replace much of the cognitive and physical labour that ageing populations can no longer provide. Japan — the nation most advanced in its demographic decline — has the highest robot density in the world: 399 industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers, compared to 285 in Germany and 255 in the United States (International Federation of Robotics, 2024). Japan is explicitly pursuing robotics as a demographic strategy, not merely an economic one.

AI systems can already diagnose diseases, write legal briefs, generate code, manage supply chains, and operate power grids with increasing autonomy. General-purpose humanoid robots — Tesla's Optimus, Figure.ai's Figure 01, several Chinese competitors — are approaching the price point ($20,000 or less) at which they become cheaper than human labour in virtually every context. If AI can maintain power stations, operate water treatment plants, manage transport networks, and run semiconductor fabrication plants, then the demographic decline of the builders becomes a solvable problem. The machines inherit what the humans can no longer sustain.

But the pessimistic case is equally compelling, and it rests on a recursive dependency that is not easily dismissed.

Who builds and maintains the AI? The answer, today, is overwhelmingly the same two populations whose demographic decline we have been documenting. The major AI laboratories — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI in the United States; Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba in China — are staffed almost entirely by engineers and researchers of European and East Asian heritage. The semiconductor fabrication plants that produce the chips on which AI runs are located in Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, and the Netherlands — and operated by workforces drawn from the same demographic pools (TSMC, Samsung, Intel, ASML annual reports).

The physical infrastructure that AI requires is vast and fragile. Data centres consume enormous quantities of electricity — which must be generated and distributed by power grids. Those grids require maintenance by skilled engineers. The data centres themselves require cooling systems, fibre-optic connectivity, and a supply chain of components that stretches from rare earth mines in Inner Mongolia to precision optics laboratories in Oberkochen, Germany. Every layer of the AI stack depends on physical infrastructure that human beings must build, operate, and maintain.

Here is where the Eskom parallel becomes instructive. If a country with South Africa's resources and inherited infrastructure cannot maintain a fleet of 1970s-era coal power stations, the notion that it — or any similar context — could build and maintain a hyperscale AI data centre operating at the frontier of semiconductor technology is not credible. The skills gap is not smaller with AI. It is larger.

The optimists will respond that AI can eventually maintain itself — that once the system reaches sufficient capability, it can manage its own infrastructure, diagnose its own faults, and direct its own repairs. This may prove correct. But it depends on a critical assumption: that the initial build-out of self-sustaining AI infrastructure is completed before the populations capable of building it have declined below the threshold of competence. If the builders disappear before the machines are ready, the window closes.

The Roman aqueducts were the most sophisticated water engineering systems the world had ever seen. They supplied fresh water to cities of a million people, over distances of up to 90 kilometres, using nothing but gravity and precision stonework. After Rome fell, nobody knew how to fix them. The knowledge was not written down in a form that the inheriting populations could use. It took a thousand years before European cities again had reliable water supply (Ward-Perkins, 2005).

Could the same happen with semiconductor fabrication? With AI data centres? With the electrical grid? The technology is more complex, more interdependent, and more fragile than anything the Romans built. And the populations that understand it are shrinking faster than the Roman citizenry ever did.

## The Window

Here, then, is where we stand.

The two civilisational traditions that designed, built, and currently operate the infrastructure of the modern world — European and East Asian — are in demographic collapse. The numbers are not ambiguous. Europe will lose a quarter of its population by 2100. China will lose nearly half. South Korea and Japan will lose a third to two-fifths. These are the UN's median projections, not worst-case scenarios.

No policy intervention in history has reversed a sustained fertility rate below 1.5. Augustus failed. Singapore failed. South Korea is spending 270 trillion won ($200 billion) over the next five years on pro-natalist policies (Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2024). If past evidence is any guide, it will fail too.

The evidence from contexts where populations have inherited complex systems they did not build — from post-Roman Europe to post-colonial Africa to post-apartheid South Africa — suggests that institutions and infrastructure do not maintain themselves. They require the specific human capital that created them. When that capital departs, the systems decay. Not immediately. Not uniformly. But inexorably.

AI and robotics represent the most plausible technological solution — perhaps the only one. But AI itself is a product of the very populations now in decline, and its physical infrastructure is more complex and more demanding than anything those populations have previously built. The recursive dependency is real: the tool that might save the builders is itself being built by the builders, and it is not yet finished.

The window is perhaps twenty to forty years. That is roughly the time before European and East Asian working-age populations begin to decline catastrophically, and roughly the time that optimistic projections give for AI to achieve the kind of autonomous capability that could sustain complex infrastructure without large-scale human oversight. Whether these two timelines intersect — whether the machines are ready before the builders are gone — is the most consequential question of the twenty-first century.

If they do intersect, then the demographic collapse of the world's builder populations becomes a transition, not a catastrophe. The machines carry forward what the humans can no longer sustain. Civilisation's operating system runs on silicon rather than carbon, and the world continues to function regardless of who lives in it.

If they do not, then the modern world — its electricity, its medicine, its food systems, its communications, its clean water — may follow the Roman aqueducts into ruin. Not because anyone chose to destroy it. Not because of malice or ideology or war. But because the people who knew how to keep it running were no longer there, and no one else had learned, and the machines were not yet ready.

The builders are dying. The inheritors have not yet shown they can maintain what was built. The machines are not yet finished.

The clock on the schoolhouse wall in Albinen is still ticking.

But for whom?
