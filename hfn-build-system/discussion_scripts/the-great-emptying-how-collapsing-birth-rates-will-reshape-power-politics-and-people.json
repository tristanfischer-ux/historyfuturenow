    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, that's completely wrong. Immigration brings economic benefits. New workers, new ideas. We've published articles on China's rise based on similar dynamics."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It does, yes. But the demographic problem? The numbers simply don't add up long-term. You need ever-larger waves to compensate."

  {
    "speaker": "Elena",

  },

    "speaker": "James",

  },
