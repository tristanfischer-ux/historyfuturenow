The reader suggested that the sheer number of disaffected young people would inevitably lead to 'countless uprisings in most European countries' and a 'profound revolution' marked by 'extreme violence and breakneck speed.' This, quite naturally, led us to ask: What exactly does it take to get Europeans to have a revolution? Our recent analysis on History Future Now explores this by looking back at over sixty instances of civil unrest, protest, riots, and full-blown civil wars across Europe in the last few hundred years."

And if we're broadening the definition of 'revolution' to include any form of civil unrest, aren't we diluting the very concept? Surely, there's a significant difference between a protest march and, say, the beheading of a king, which I presume we'll be discussing."

    "text": "Indeed, and that's precisely where our historical journey begins. The article argues that a broad definition is necessary because these events often exist on a continuum. We start, quite fittingly for us, with the English Civil War, or English Revolution, of 1642. Far from a popular uprising for democracy, this was fundamentally a struggle for control between King Charles I, who sought to rule absolutely, and Parliament, representing the wealthy and powerful upper-middle classes, who felt their traditional influence and right to control taxation was being circumvented. Parliament won, the King was executed, and they ultimately invited his son back on *their* terms. The lesson: the landed gentry and emergent merchant class would fight, even to regicide, to protect their power and wealth."

    "text": "So, the first major 'revolution' you cite was essentially a power grab by one segment of the elite from another. Hardly the romantic image of the common man rising up. If that's the blueprint, as the article suggests, then it rather deflates the idea of a 'profound revolution' driven by the masses of unemployed youth today. Where do the toiling classes, who fought Parliament's war for a 'reliable salary,' fit into this grand narrative of change if the ultimate outcome was merely a reshuffling of the top brass?"

    "text": "An astute observation, and one that resonates through much of early European revolutionary history. The Glorious Revolution of 1688, for instance, was another pre-emptive strike by Parliament – this time against James II's Catholic leanings and the birth of a Catholic heir, which threatened their Protestant-secured wealth and status. They invited William of Orange to invade, effectively deposing their king. Again, the 'upper middle classes of Britain would fight to keep their wealth and their power,' as the article states. Even the American Revolution, starting in 1775, despite its republican outcome, was primarily about 'wealthy British citizens in America' fighting to secure the same rights – specifically representation and control over taxation – enjoyed by their counterparts in Britain. They objected to distant politicians making rules and setting taxes without their consent, a sentiment not entirely dissimilar to some of the criticisms levelled against the European Union today."

While Brexiters might rail against Brussels, I struggle to see a modern Briton genuinely feeling 'subjugated' by the EU in the same way American colonists felt by the British Parliament, given their drastically superior local representation compared to the American provincial assemblies of the 18th century. Those colonists were fighting for *equal* rights, whereas today's Europeans generally have them, albeit within a complex supranational framework. The scale of indignity feels fundamentally different. And certainly, no one is threatening to behead an EU commissioner for a lack of parliamentary representation."

However, the French Revolution of 1789 truly shifts the paradigm. Unlike Britain's gradual evolution, France under Louis XVI was an autocratic monarchy with an immensely powerful, tax-exempt Catholic Church owning 10% of the land. A severe financial crisis, exacerbated by costly wars like the American Revolutionary War, forced Louis XVI to convene the Estates-General in 1789 – an assembly not called for 175 years. This was his undoing. By allowing the Third Estate, the common people, to hold elections and form the National Assembly, he inadvertently gave power to a populace 'fed up with bad government that kept them both poor and unable to do anything about their fate.' This rapidly devolved into a 'total war,' affecting everyone, culminating in the king's execution and the declaration of a republic. Here, we see genuine mass involvement, driven by economic hardship and a profound lack of agency, a stark contrast to the earlier elite power struggles."

    "text": "Now *that* sounds more like the reader's prediction. Poverty, lack of agency, a sense of injustice – these are potent ingredients. And when you factor in our article on 'Robotics and Slavery,' which highlights the potential for widespread job displacement due to automation, the 'What are all these people going to do?' question becomes profoundly more urgent. Could a modern-day financial crisis, coupled with mass technological unemployment, create a similar 'Pandora's Box' for a European government that allows a mechanism for the disaffected to coalesce and act? The French were 'given the opportunity to have power,' but what if no such mechanism exists today beyond online echo chambers?"

    "text": "A crucial point. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 offers another perspective on the 'pushing people too far' argument. Here, it wasn't just about internal power dynamics, but outright discrimination by a foreign power. For centuries, Irish Catholics faced systematic exclusion from public office, land ownership, and even basic rights, a policy of appalling behaviour from the British state. The article highlights that 'if you push a people too far and discriminate against them because of who they are... then you should expect a revolt.' This links to a broader theme we've explored, for instance, in 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power,' where we examined the historical patterns of favouritism and resource extraction by external entities. This concept of a supranational state needing to provide equal opportunities for all citizens, without favouritism towards an 'official' group, is critical. Imperial Rome, as the article notes, flourished when it allowed all citizens access to power, but declined when it adopted Christianity as an official religion, thereby excluding many and sowing conflict."

    "text": "And yet, you also claim that viewing the Irish Rebellion as an attempt to 'throw off the British yoke' is anachronistic, stating that 'national identity' was a relatively new concept. That feels like a bit of a contradiction. Surely, even if the academic concept of 'nation-state' hadn't fully crystallised, the Irish, having their lands confiscated and being systematically oppressed by an external power, felt a distinct collective identity and grievance that wasn't merely about elite power struggles or abstract 'equality of opportunity.' They were being discriminated against because of *who they were*, irrespective of how that 'who' was officially defined."

    "text": "The article suggests that while distinct cultural identity certainly existed, the *political framework* of 'national self-determination' largely emerged after the French Revolution and only truly took hold post-WWI with Woodrow Wilson's declarations. Nonetheless, the core grievance of systematic discrimination is undeniable. The Serbian Revolution, from 1804-1817, further illustrates this. Serbs, an Orthodox Christian Slavic people, rebelled against the Ottoman Turks, Shia Muslims speaking a Turkic language. The Ottomans, much like the British in Ireland, favoured their own ethnic and religious group, leading to inevitable inequality. The Serbs, inspired by the French and American Revolutions and buoyed by Napoleon's reshaping of Europe and Russia's growing assertiveness, successfully fought for semi-independence. The Greek Revolution, starting in 1821, was another instance of 'contagion,' with external powers like Russia, the UK, and France supporting the Greeks against the Ottomans. These later revolutions clearly show the rise of what we now recognise as nationalism, coalescing around shared language, religion, and a desire to throw off what was perceived as foreign, discriminatory rule."

    "text": "So, we have a trajectory: from elite power struggles, to the French Revolution's mass popular uprising driven by poverty and lack of agency, to nationalistic revolts against foreign or discriminatory rule. The common threads, then, seem to be a breakdown of state legitimacy, severe economic hardship, and a profound sense of unfairness or lack of control, often exacerbated by external influences or the contagion of ideas. Given this historical sweep, and the current economic anxieties, the refugee crisis, and persistent youth unemployment – which our piece 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West' touches upon – are we not seeing many of these conditions brewing in Europe today? Is the continent that 'invented total war,' as our 'Europe Rearms' article calls it, simply biding its time before another period of internal upheaval?"

    "text": "That is the critical question. While the modern European state possesses a far more sophisticated social safety net and mechanisms of control than any of these historical examples, the underlying factors remain potent. A sense of a declining West, as explored in 'The Rise of the West Was Based on Luck. That Has Run Out,' combined with demographic shifts and economic stagnation, could erode legitimacy. The youth unemployment figures in some Southern European states are truly alarming, creating a generation with little stake in the status quo. If these problems are allowed to fester, and if a powerful enough trigger – perhaps another profound financial crisis, or a perceived external threat as discussed in 'The North African Threat' – were to emerge, it's not entirely inconceivable that the historical patterns of discontent, dissatisfaction, and the desire for control could once again manifest. The question isn't whether Europeans are *capable* of revolution, the history shows they are, but rather, what specific confluence of pressures would be required to shift them from inertia to action in the 21st century. And what would such a revolution even look like?"
