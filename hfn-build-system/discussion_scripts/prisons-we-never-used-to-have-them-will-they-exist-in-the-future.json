    "text": "You say 'modern invention' like it's a bad thing. Before Bentham, it was stocks, public hangings, or banishment to a colony."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And significantly cheaper, Elena. That's the point the article makes. Hugely cheaper."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Cost isn't the only metric for justice. Surely, we've evolved beyond that."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] But we're spending £37,000 per prisoner per year in the UK. On a child's education? £5,000."

    "speaker": "Elena",

    "text": "In an age of austerity, they absolutely are. Every pound has to earn its keep. We touched on this in 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West'."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we just go back to sending people off to Australia? Or the gallows? Come on."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article highlights the crisis after losing the American colonies. England had to house prisoners somewhere, hence the hulks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's hardly a success story. Just a different kind of horror."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But a fiscally driven one. Our current system is utterly unsustainable long-term."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, that's completely wrong. We can afford it if we prioritise it. It's a choice."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Is it? The numbers don't lie. Ninety thousand people in prison in the UK. That's a town's worth of inmates."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the solution is to shorten sentences, or make them work for free? That sounds like punishment, not reform."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Reform is expensive. And it's not clear it's always effective. Historically, societies often chose cheaper, harsher options."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] Because they were brutal and unfeeling! We're supposed to have moved past that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But what if the economic imperative becomes too strong to ignore? What if that's the real driver of 'progress'?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You're saying austerity forces us back into a pre-Enlightenment penal system? That's bleak."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not necessarily pre-Enlightenment, but certainly pre-Bentham. Transportation, for example, built empires. 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' explores that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we turn prisoners into forced labour for state projects? That's a terrifying thought."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's one of the options the article raises: 'Should prisoners be made to work and provide enough value to offset the cost?'"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Yes, but that's about offsetting cost, not just shipping them off. It implies rehabilitation, or at least a path back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But the cost remains the core issue. When you're spending eight times more on a prisoner than a schoolchild..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I remember you called that number devastating. It does stick with you."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] And if the West's luck has run out, as another article suggests, these costs become impossible."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, fine. I'll give you that the economic pressure is immense. It's undeniable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "So, what gives? Shorter sentences? Less secure prisons, as the article suggests, where they work during the day?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Shorter sentences, perhaps, for non-violent offenders. If rehabilitation is effective. But the public won't accept that for serious crime."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But the alternative is to bankrupt the state, or to start making truly awful choices about who gets locked up."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "This feels like a return to first principles. What is prison actually *for*? Is it punishment, deterrence, or reform?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And which of those can we still afford in the 21st century? That's the brutal question."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "We can't just abandon the idea of reform. But I see your point about the sheer expense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The public demands security. But doesn't want to pay the bill for it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's a societal Catch-22. I just hope we don't swing back to the brutal 'efficiency' of earlier eras."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "History does rhyme, Elena. And societies under stress often choose efficiency over costly ideals."
