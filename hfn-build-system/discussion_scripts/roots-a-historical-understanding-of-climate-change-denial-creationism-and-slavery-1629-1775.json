    "text": "The article suggests a deeply provocative link, Elena: American climate change denial, creationism, and even historical support for slavery. All tied to biblical justification and a stark geographic overlap."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's quite a leap, James. Seriously. Are you really equating modern environmental views with 17th-century slavery?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] Not equating, observing a correlation. Look at the maps. The 2008 electoral map, post-Johnson's realignment, mirrors the pre-Civil War slave states almost perfectly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes. And overlay that with the Baptist adherence map. The overlap is striking. That's the first data point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, a geographic correlation. But correlation isn't causation. People move, societies change dramatically over centuries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] People don't move enough. Not to erase four centuries of foundational culture. That's precisely the argument the piece makes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Four centuries? Come on. Are you saying the Civil War is still dictating who believes in evolution today?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not directly. But the roots are shared. Genesis 9:25-27 justified slavery. That same interpretive tradition informs creationism."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The Canaan curse? I know it was used, but that's... medieval thinking. Surely it's not still relevant."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And Genesis 8:22, Noah's covenant. The Cornwall Alliance uses it today for climate denial. God promised no more floods."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] That's an oversimplification. We're reducing the entire climate debate to a literal reading of Genesis?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "For a significant segment of the denial movement in specific regions, yes. Plus the idea that man cannot harm what God made 'good'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the North has religious people too!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "True. Which is why 'Albion's Seed' is so crucial. Different British folkways, different interpretations, different societies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Ah, Fischer. I remember that book. But how much of that 17th-century migration really dictates 21st-century environmental policy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It set the bedrock. The Puritans to New England: high literacy, education, open to Enlightenment science. They founded Harvard."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, Puritan pragmatism?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "More receptive to science, yes. Contrast that with the Southern Cavaliers. Second sons, hierarchy, used to feudalism. Slavery wasn't a conceptual leap."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the Scotch-Irish in Appalachia. The 'leave us alone' mentality. Strong views on states' rights."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. The article notes their home territories were less developed. That individualism, that distrust of central authority, persists."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, it's not just religion, it's the *kind* of religion, and the underlying social structure brought over. I see your point about the 'bedrock'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] It's never *just* one thing. But the cultural DNA is surprisingly resilient. Remember our 'Crisis' piece, about the decline of the West? These are deep currents."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Yes, but that dealt with broader civilisational shifts. I'm still struggling with the idea that our 'Scramble For The Solar System' is shaped by 17th-century English migration patterns."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] It's about how different regions fundamentally view collective action, regulation, and scientific consensus. That impacts everything. Even space exploration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You're suggesting an early emphasis on education in the North led to a greater acceptance of scientific consensus, including climate change. While the South's more hierarchical, less educated roots allowed biblical literalism to flourish unchallenged, perhaps even encouraged it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article is quite explicit. 'High levels of literacy and an emphasis on education... made them more receptive to the Enlightenment and concepts of science'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And conversely, the South sometimes made educating slaves illegal. That's a stark contrast."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A very stark contrast. It ensured the perpetuation of certain narratives and power structures."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But what about modern immigration? Catholics from Ireland, Poland, Italy settling in the North East. Doesn't that scramble the picture?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It made significant changes, certainly. But the article concludes the foundational 'bedrock' was already formed. New arrivals integrated into existing cultural patterns."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[sardonic] So we're essentially stuck with a 17th-century cultural inheritance, forever?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not stuck, but understanding its influence is crucial. It's about recognising the deep 'Roots'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I suppose it explains why some debates feel intractable. You're arguing against something far deeper than policy preferences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "You are. You're arguing against an entire historical worldview, shaped by centuries of cultural evolution."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's... actually quite a devastating thought for political change."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] Indeed. 'Understanding our history' is the first step, as the article says."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I just wish the history wasn't quite so... stubbornly persistent. It feels almost deterministic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps less 'deterministic' and more 'highly influential'. The Rhine doesn't change course easily."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Fine. But it means if you want to tackle climate change, you're also wrestling with Genesis. That's a heavier lift than just carbon taxes."
