  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Right, because iPads are so much more complex than power stations. I get it. But that's just the nature of infrastructure, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's more than just 'nature'. It means the pricing signals capitalism relies on simply don't work. By the time new supply comes online, demand has often completely shifted."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, you're saying the market isn't equipped to handle long-term planning?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. Look at the US fracking boom. Natural gas flooded the market, prices plummeted. Multi-billion dollar LNG terminals went bust."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And that's a problem for the investor, not the consumer, surely?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, it's terrible resource optimisation. During low prices, everyone buys gas-guzzlers. Then, when the market inevitably corrects—"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, 'inevitably corrects'? That sounds like a crystal ball, not economics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article's point is clear: long-term, global demand is up, supply is down. The only long-term direction for energy prices is up."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, fine. I'll give you that long-term trend. But what's the alternative to market signals? Government intervention?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] The proposed solution is a price floor. The government guarantees prices won't drop, taxing any dips to maintain it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A price floor? That's just a stealth tax, isn't it? Hidden from view."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It could be seen that way. But the article suggests a mechanism: a 90% corporation tax rebate on the additional tax generated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Ninety percent? So it's still costing companies something. That's a direct hit to competitiveness on the global stage, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The net impact on post-tax profit would be similar. And it drives efficiency. Companies will reduce consumption to save money."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But surely, higher energy prices discourage investment in *new*, cheaper renewable sources? Why innovate if prices are artificially high?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, not at all. If the market price is £110 and you can produce at £90, you still make your £20 profit. Certainty boosts investment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hmm. That's... actually harder to argue with than I expected."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It reduces market risk, lowers the cost of capital. That means greater innovation, exactly what we need for the 'renewables and battery revolution' we discussed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, it's not about making energy expensive, but making its cost *predictable*?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. Predictable, and always incentivising efficiency. Think about the 'Who Are The Losers In The Energy Revolution?' piece. Certainty helps winners."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[thoughtful] I see the logic for producers. They get stability, which is what 'established companies in established industries all like,' as the article states."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But what about ordinary consumers? They're still paying higher, consistent prices for energy. That feels unfair."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They'd know the cost won't go down. That encourages them to invest in energy-efficient homes and vehicles. Long-term savings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that's a huge upfront cost for many families. They're forced to cut back on basics during price spikes anyway, as the article mentions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's about avoiding those wild swings. The current system is 'incredibly wasteful,' leading to abandoned houses and plummeting resale values for gas-guzzlers. A floor prevents that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] But it's still government manipulating a core market! It flies in the face of free-market principles, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article argues even the great capitalists, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, sought to create stability and dominance once established. They hated uncertainty. This is a capitalist solution to a market failure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a convenient reading of history, honestly. They created monopolies, not price floors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The *principle* is the same: reduce uncertainty. If governments want a competitive edge, they need to facilitate a transition to renewables as 'quickly and as cheaply as possible'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So this is about national champions, competitive advantage... not just efficiency?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's about both. Greater profits, greater tax revenues, greater geopolitical power. It's an aggressive, capitalist-oriented government policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I don't want to agree with you on this, but the data on long lead times and market volatility... it makes a strong case for *some* kind of intervention."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I just worry about the political implications. People will see higher energy bills and blame the government, not the long-term benefit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Which is why the article mentions the 'stealth tax' perception. But it insists it's good for industry, consumers, and the environment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hmm. And it nudges us towards renewables without being overtly 'green', which might appeal to those 'right-wing opposition' types you mentioned."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. It makes environmentalism a 'blue' proposition, not a 'red' one."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But are we just creating a new set of problems down the line? Subsidising high prices... it feels like we're just kicking the can."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Or creating the stable environment for the inevitable long-term rise in energy costs to be managed, rather than suffered. That's the question, isn't it?"
