    "text": "No, but the article points out the absurdity: 2 to 15 years for energy development, versus 12-18 months for consumer goods. It causes absolute chaos. Projects approved during high demand come online during a recession, bankrupting investors. Then demand recovers, prices spike, and we're left with—"

  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Brownouts? That's a failure of policy, not markets. Or rather, a failure of *government* to manage the market signals properly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The market *fails* here, Elena. The pricing signals are always five to ten years out of date. And private capital, as the article reminds us, hates uncertainty."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Says who?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "History. Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt. Once they established dominance, their primary goal wasn't more competition, it was *stability*. Uncertainty is only good for new entrants, exploiting niches. Most companies want certainty."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that was the Gilded Age! We have anti-monopoly legislation now, regulations. It’s a different environment."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The *fundamental* problem of 5-15 year investment cycles hasn't changed. The structural reality. So, if the market can't provide the long-term signals, what does?"

  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You're not suggesting more government intervention, are you? A return to nationalisation, perhaps?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, not at all. A price floor for energy. Not a ceiling, a floor. As the article proposes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really? That sounds... deeply counter-intuitive. What’s the logic?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The logic is certainty. The article argues the long-term trend for energy is inevitably up anyway – more people, more affluence, finite resources. A price floor simply formalises that reality."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a convenient reading of the data. Higher demand, lower supply, so prices *must* go up? Isn't that just a pessimistic forecast?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article is quite clear on it: 'The price of energy has only one long term direction: up.' It’s a structural force, not just a forecast. And since infrastructure lasts decades, today's price signals have multi-generational impact."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, so a price floor means the government steps in when global prices drop and... taxes it? To keep the consumer price artificially high?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The government pledges never to let the price *decrease* to consumers, by taxing any global price drop."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a stealth tax, plain and simple! People will see through that instantly. It's politically unpalatable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They might, initially. But the proposal isn't just a tax. It includes a corporate tax rebate for businesses buying the energy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A rebate? For the company, not the individual consumer at the pump?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "For the company. A 90% deduction from their corporation tax, to be exact, offsetting the energy tax increase. That 10% gap still incentivises them to reduce consumption."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hmm. So the *company's* net energy costs would be similar to what they would have been without the tax, but they're permanently incentivised to reduce consumption? I can see the logic for businesses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. It shifts the incentive from buying cheap, inefficient equipment to investing in long-term efficiency. The article calls it a 'permanent competitive advantage' for nations that implement it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But consumers still pay the higher price. They just... don't benefit from global price drops. That's a hard sell politically, no matter the corporate benefits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a long-term play. It forces everyone, companies and individuals, to act as if energy is consistently expensive, driving innovation. Think about how that affects investment in renewables."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I suppose... if you know prices won't drop, you're always seeking efficiency. That makes sense for industrial strategy. But producers, wouldn't they be put off by perpetually high prices?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, quite the opposite! This is where it gets interesting. It dramatically reduces risk for new energy projects."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, it *helps* new low-cost energy? Wouldn't higher prices discour—"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No. The article argues if you can produce oil at $90 and the market is $110, you make $20. If the market drops to $100 and the government adds a $10 tax, you still sell at $110 and keep your $20 profit. Certainty breeds investment, not discourages it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating for my prior assumption. I had no idea it would work like that. It provides a stable, high revenue floor for new producers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. Think about our 'renewables and battery revolution' piece. This kind of certainty would accelerate that shift, wouldn't it? Reduce the cost of capital for those huge, long-term investments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It would, yes. I'm thinking about those European utilities facing an 'existential crisis' from price volatility. This would stabilise their revenue streams considerably."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Correct. This policy stabilises the economics across the board for energy. It reduces market risk and drives innovation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "My main hang-up is still the optics. A government actively *taxing* a price drop to keep prices high... that sounds like a headline waiting to explode. Even if the economic logic is sound."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A fair point on the political communication. But which is worse: that, or brownouts, bankruptcies, and a wildly inefficient energy sector that wastes capital and resources?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, I concede the waste is enormous. 'Incredibly wasteful,' as the article put it. The boom-bust cycle is just... terrible for long-term planning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. And it pushes us towards short-sighted choices in infrastructure and consumer behaviour."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, fine. I'll give you that the economic case for certainty is incredibly strong here, especially for long-term infrastructure and new energy development. I still don't like the 'stealth tax' label for consumers. But the producer side... that's genuinely innovative."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's about aligning incentives for the long haul. Recognising that energy isn't an iPad Mini, it's the bedrock of the economy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Ha! Good luck explaining that to the electorate. But I see the wisdom in it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But the alternative is continuing this 'terrible system.' And as our piece 'Green Is Not Red, But Blue' suggests, sometimes the pragmatic solution requires rethinking old political labels."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a good point. We're too often stuck in ideological ruts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. This is about national competitive advantage and resource optimisation for the next century."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I'm persuaded by the economic argument for producers and efficiency. I'm just not sure it's *saleable*. But the *logic* holds, disturbingly so."
