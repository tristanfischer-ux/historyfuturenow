    "text": "[dry] Fifteen years? A bit dramatic, isn't it? The market always corrects eventually."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Not for nuclear power. It can take a decade just for consents, another five years to build. Oil and gas fields, LNG terminals, same story. That’s why we get these boom-bust cycles."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Okay, the lag is undeniable. But the article suggests a government-mandated price floor. That sounds like economic interference to me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's about certainty, James. Investors shy away from building new capacity because prices swing wildly. Remember those US LNG terminals almost defaulting? Or wind projects struggling without subsidies?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[surprised] Wait, really? Even wind projects with good locations?"
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Yes. They were developed assuming good wholesale prices, then fracking flooded the market. Suddenly, multi-billion dollar projects were teetering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Hmm. So the very long development cycles make traditional pricing signals actively misleading for investors. That's a harder problem than I usually account for."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Exactly. That leads to underinvestment, then demand spikes, and suddenly we're predicting brownouts in the UK. It's wildly inefficient."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It sounds like the 'existential crisis' for European utilities we discussed. They couldn't react fast enough either."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And what about consumer behaviour? Low prices tell people to buy gas guzzlers and build energy-intensive homes. Then prices spike, and they're abandoning houses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's a fair point. People react to short-term signals, not the 25-60 year lifespan of infrastructure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But historically, price controls have been a disaster. From Roman grain prices to Soviet planning. How is this different?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "This isn't a price ceiling, James. It's a floor. The government only intervenes when prices fall too much, by taxing the drop to maintain a consistent price for consumers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A stealth tax, then. Consumers would pay more than the global market price. That's hardly competitive for industry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The article addresses that. It suggests rebating 90% of that tax against corporation tax. So the net impact on a company's post-tax profit is the same."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, that's completely wrong. Even with a rebate, higher gross energy costs put them at a disadvantage. Their input costs are higher."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[emphatic] But it permanently incentivises efficiency. If energy prices are always high, companies have to innovate to reduce consumption. That gives them a competitive edge over countries without the policy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] So the market signal is always 'be efficient,' rather than 'waste energy when it's cheap, panic when it's expensive'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Precisely. And that innovation flows into their global operations. They become intrinsically more efficient."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "What about new, cheaper energy sources? If the government keeps the price high, where's the incentive to develop something truly low-cost?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's also addressed. If the global price is $110 and you produce at $90, you still make $20 profit. If global drops to $100 and the government taxes $10, you still sell at $110 and keep your $20 profit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Ah. So it protects the profit margin for efficient producers, rather than capping it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And it gives them certainty. That's crucial for the massive upfront capital needed in energy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] Okay, I'll grant you that. The long investment cycles and the capital intensity are unique challenges. Traditional market signals do seem to fail here. It's not just a 'green' pipe dream."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the article's point about the renewables and battery revolution? This policy accelerates that. It creates a stable environment for green investment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[clipped] I'm still wary of explicitly 'green' policies, you know that. But the economic case for long-term stability in a sector like energy, with multi-decade infrastructure, is becoming harder to ignore."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But you can't separate the economic and environmental here, James. We know from 'Dealing With Climate Change Inaction' that it's happening. Stable investment in renewables is a pragmatic response."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Pragmatic, yes. If the market itself is creating these boom-bust cycles and deterring necessary investment, then some mechanism to provide certainty might be justified. Even if it's a very un-free-market approach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And it provides a competitive advantage for national champions. Other economies will flounder with outdated pricing information. Our businesses will be leaner, more efficient."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It still feels like picking winners, though. Even if it's market-friendly winners. The bureaucracy involved in managing those rebates and taxes..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Compared to grid collapse or families abandoning homes? It's a calculated trade-off for systemic stability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] Fine. I'll give you that the long-term nature of energy infrastructure makes it an exceptional case where pure market signals can be deeply suboptimal. It's not just standard corporate greed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's good for industry, consumers, and the environment. Certainty reduces risk, lowers capital costs, drives innovation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] So, essentially, a price floor forces the market to behave as if energy prices are always going up, which they probably will be anyway."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Precisely. It's anticipating the future, rather than constantly reacting to a broken past. And that's what History Future Now is all about, isn't it?"
