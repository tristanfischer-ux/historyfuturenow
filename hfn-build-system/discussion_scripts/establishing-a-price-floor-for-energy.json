    "text": "The energy sector is an anomaly, isn't it? We talk about market signals, but when it takes a decade to get an LNG terminal approved and built, what good are today's prices for tomorrow's supply?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Exactly. The article really hammers home that disconnect. A 12-18 month cycle for a new iPad versus 2 to 15 years for power generation or a new oil field. It's a fundamental flaw in how we expect these markets to function."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A fundamental flaw with very real consequences. We see it in the boom and bust cycles. Prices are low, investors shy away, existing plants get mothballed. Then demand spikes, prices rocket, and we're left with blackouts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Like the UK's predictions of brownouts, or how those multi-billion dollar LNG terminals in the US were suddenly in trouble when fracking flooded the market. It's an inefficient, wasteful system from a capital allocation perspective."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The market signals are so delayed they become noise, not guidance. When prices are low, we're encouraged to be wasteful, buying gas-guzzling cars. Then prices surge, and families are left abandoning homes because they can't afford the heating."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So the solution proposed is a government-mandated price floor. Essentially, always keeping energy prices artificially high, even when global markets drop, through a specific tax mechanism. That feels... counter-intuitive to a free market approach."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It is, initially. But the article argues the private sector can't solve this. Historically, once industrial giants like Rockefeller or Vanderbilt established dominance, their primary goal wasn't competition, but stability. They sought monopolies precisely to remove price uncertainty."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And today's energy giants are no different, but anti-monopoly laws prevent them from achieving that stability naturally. So the state steps in to provide it. But a perpetual energy tax, to ensure prices 'never decrease'—that sounds like a stealth tax, James."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A fair point, and the article addresses it. The proposal is to compensate businesses through corporation tax rebates. If the government taxes an additional £10 per barrel, companies get a 90% rebate on that increase against their income tax."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Ninety per cent. So companies still feel a 10% pinch. That's a direct incentive to reduce consumption, isn't it? But then, how does having higher energy costs make a nation's industry more competitive globally, as the article claims?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Because it forces innovation in energy efficiency. If energy costs are permanently high, businesses are incentivised to invest in more efficient processes and technologies. Over time, that efficiency provides a competitive edge over countries operating with cheaper, but more volatile, energy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I see the logic. It's a long-term play, demanding foresight that most political cycles simply don't have. But what about new, low-cost energy sources like renewables? Doesn't a high price floor disincentivise their development?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Quite the opposite, the article argues. If the market price is £110 and you can produce at £90, you still make your £20 profit. The certainty provided by the price floor actually makes investment in new technologies, whether it's solar or next-gen nuclear, far less risky and more attractive. It de-risks the capital."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So it underwrites the 'renewables and battery revolution' we discussed in that other piece, by creating a stable investment environment. That's a compelling argument for capital deployment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. It means greater profit certainty for producers, and constant pressure for efficiency from consumers. Which, incidentally, is good for the environment. It connects to our discussion in 'Green Is Not Red, But Blue'—a capitalist mechanism that delivers environmental benefits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's certainly not the environmentalism typically decried by the right. This is an economic lever with ecological consequences, rather than the other way around. But the public, James? They want cheap energy, not a guaranteed floor."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Short-term, yes. But the long-term trend, the article states, is 'higher global demand and lower global supply' for fossil fuels. Prices have only one direction: up. We're simply smoothing out the inevitable, and doing so in a way that encourages adaptation rather than crisis response."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And that adaptability is crucial, especially given that we've already admitted 'climate change is happening and there is no viable political solution which will enable us to stop it from getting worse.' This policy sounds like a tool for managing the consequences, as we explored in 'Dealing With The Consequences of Climate Change Inaction'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. It's about preparedness. An aggressive, capitalist-oriented government, as the article suggests, would use this to give its national champions a competitive edge. Greater profits, tax revenues, geopolitical power. It's a strategic move."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It implies a level of state intervention and long-term planning that feels very un-Western in its current political climate. Imagine trying to sell this to an electorate demanding lower utility bills."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a challenge, undoubtedly. But the alternative is continued volatility, wasted capital, and the disruptive economic and social consequences of energy shocks. The cost of doing nothing, or rather, continuing with the current approach, is arguably far higher."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Perhaps. We've seen 'Big European Electricity Utilities' reeling from market shifts they couldn't predict. This could prevent that. But persuading populations that paying more now for long-term stability and efficiency is a good deal? That's the real political tightrope, isn't it?"
