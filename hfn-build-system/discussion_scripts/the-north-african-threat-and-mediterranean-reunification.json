    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A tidal wave of *people*, James, not inherently a threat. Their GDP per capita is barely $3,000. Poverty is the real issue, surely?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But the article highlights that combination: poor, young, rapidly growing populations, and food insecure. Historically, that's rarely a recipe for stability. For them, or for us."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, your argument is the EU just... waits for the inevitable deluge?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] That's one option. Or we consider the historical pattern. Remember the Vandals crossing into North Africa, then sacking Rome?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That was 5th century AD! Are you seriously equating modern migration with a Germanic tribe's invasion?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The *pattern* of population pressure leading to mass movement, yes. History Future Now has written extensively on how 'history rhymes'. Look at 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, fine, historical parallels can be interesting. But predicting North Africans in Europe forming a 'swing political party' or resorting to 'aggressive rioting'... that's deeply alarmist."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] The article says their family members are starving. That's an existential threat. What do people do when facing that?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "They seek help, they seek asylum. They don't automatically turn into a political bloc bent on destroying European democracies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But the pressure exists. And the article posits the 'moral nightmare' of stopping boats. What's the alternative when millions are trying to cross?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] That's exactly the kind of thinking that backs us into a corner! We're talking about human lives, James. Not statistics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. Which is why the suggested 'miracle' solution, 'Mediterranean Reunification', needs serious consideration."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Reunification? It sounds suspiciously like a new form of colonialism to me. 'Come into our free trade zone, but no free movement'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not colonialism. It's about bringing production closer, creating jobs *there*. Factories in Morocco, selling tariff-free into the EU. Better than buying from China, surely?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Hmm. Substituting Chinese imports... that does make a certain kind of economic sense for Europe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And it creates jobs for North Africans. Instead of us discussing 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power', we'd be building a new Mediterranean economic hub."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay. I'll give you the economic upside for North Africa, and for Europe, if it really does mean less reliance on Asia."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And think of DESERTEC, powering Europe with Sahara solar. More jobs. Energy security."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That part, I like. A lot. It's genuinely collaborative."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. Shared prosperity, shared energy. A historical echo of the Roman breadbasket, but with solar panels."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the 'strings attached' bit. Educating women to lower fertility. It feels... prescriptive, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a proven solution to demographic pressure. And it helps reduce reliance on Saudi-funded, more extremist schools, as the article notes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I agree with the goal. But the phrasing makes me wary of cultural imposition. It needs to be genuine partnership."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's about support, not dictation. Providing alternatives."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the lack of automatic free movement? That's still a sticking point for me. If it's 'reunification', why not full integration?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a practical measure for now. With jobs created locally, the economic impetus to move would significantly diminish anyway."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's hard to argue with the potential economic stability. I don't love the 'threat' framing, or some of the suggested limitations, but the idea of a shared Mediterranean economic future..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a bold vision. A chance to re-weave a common history, rather than just manage a crisis at the border."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Or create new tensions if it's not done right. A 'miracle' requires true partnership, not just European interests."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. It requires statesmanship. And for Europe to understand that its southern border isn't merely a boundary, but a shared destiny."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A destiny that feels a long way from the Roman Empire's grain shipments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But the logic of proximity and mutual benefit remains."
