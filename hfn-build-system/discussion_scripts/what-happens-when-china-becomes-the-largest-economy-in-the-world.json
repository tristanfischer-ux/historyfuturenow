    "text": "Mundane? They're about to become the world's largest economy. The OECD predicts it in three years. That's not mundane."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "True, in raw GDP terms. But the article argues it changes almost nothing for at least a generation. A big number isn't instant hegemony."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a convenient reading. History shows economic power translates. Always has."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not always directly. The US overtook the UK economically in the 1880s. But Britain still dominated globally for decades after. Militarily, politically."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's because the US was isolationist, preoccupied with its own continent. China is anything but."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But US global dominance only crystallised after two world wars decimated everyone else's industrial base. That's a 'one-off boost', as the article puts it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we need a global calamity for China to truly dominate? That's a disturbing thought."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It is. But the point is, their economic size alone didn't immediately translate for the US. Why would it for China?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Because they're already actively projecting power. Look at the Belt and Road, the South China Sea. That's not passive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "True. But historical China wasn't interested in global domination either. The Zheng He fleets could have reached the Americas, then they were disbanded."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Ancient history, James. This is now. They're facing unprecedented resource constraints, remember?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. Food, fresh water, oil – all globally declining relative to population. China's enormous population makes it incredibly vulnerable to external shocks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Which is why they're buying up land and resources in Africa, isn't it? As 'Why Land Deals In Africa Could Make The Great Irish Famine A Minor Event' points out."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. 'Colonising Africa by stealth,' as the article suggests, and as we explored in 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So that *is* a form of dominance. Economic, certainly. Potentially political."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's certainly influence. But it's not the gunboat diplomacy, direct military occupation of the British Empire. It's a different beast."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Are you saying it's better? Or just more subtle?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[clipped] Merely different. And it doesn't guarantee enduring economic superiority anyway."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Why not?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Advanced factory robots, 3D printing. Manufacturing could de-globalise. Done closer to home. That undermines China's core advantage."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[surprised] Wait, you think automation could shift manufacturing away from China?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Potentially. If the cost of labour becomes irrelevant, proximity to markets and resources matters more. It's the 'renewables and battery revolution' argument applied to goods."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, that's a harder point to argue with than I expected. If manufacturing truly decentralises..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Then China's 'industrial dominance' isn't a permanent state. Just like Europe's wasn't forever."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the sheer scale of their domestic market, their technological push... that's still immense power."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Undeniably. But perhaps a power that, like the US resented the UK's lingering influence post-1880, will face its own 'powerless resentment' as its economy grows without corresponding global control."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Powerless resentment? That doesn't sound stable. That sounds like a recipe for friction, not 'no change'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It implies a lack of *overt*, Western-style hegemony. Not a lack of friction. The world is becoming more multipolar, not simply switching masters."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, China becomes number one economically, but the world doesn't become 'Chinese'?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. We might watch more Chinese films, sure. Buy more Chinese brands."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's hardly the fundamental shift everyone anticipates."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It is if your baseline expectation is a new American Century, but with Mandarin."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But a huge economy still needs huge resources. And China has to get them from somewhere."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And that will create competition. But it's a competition of equals, not a new colonial order."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Equals with a massive military and a state-controlled economy that can out-compete."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] True. But also, as we noted, a population that makes it more vulnerable to those very resource shocks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, a powerful, but inherently fragile economic giant?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Perhaps. Or just another very large economy, albeit a significant one, navigating an increasingly complex century, not dominating it outright."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And leaving us all to work out what 'complex' actually means on the ground."
