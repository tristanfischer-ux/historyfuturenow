Most in the West, I suspect, don't realise its indigenous people speak Austronesian languages, closer to those heard on Easter Island or Madagascar, than to Mandarin. Yet, today, 98% of the population are Mandarin-speaking Han Chinese. Our latest article, 'Why China Could Invade Taiwan - And Get Away With It', delves into this historical peculiar, but more critically, posits a rather uncomfortable truth: that Beijing might well achieve its reunification objective without firing a shot, and that the West, particularly the United States, would likely be powerless to stop it."

    "text": "Without firing a shot? That's a bold claim, isn't it? The conventional wisdom, certainly what we're fed by the media, suggests any move on Taiwan would be a full-scale military invasion, triggering a monumental geopolitical crisis, perhaps even a direct conflict with the US. Are you suggesting that entire narrative is simply misplaced?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "Not entirely misplaced, but perhaps incomplete. History, as ever, provides the necessary context. Taiwan was a Dutch colony from 1623, then formally under Qing Dynasty rule from 1683, before Japan annexed it after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895. Fast forward to 1949, and it becomes the last redoubt of Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang government, fleeing Mao's victorious Communists. Crucially, both Taipei and Beijing long maintained the 'One China' policy, simply disagreeing on who the legitimate representative was. The article highlights that under the 1992 Consensus, both sides still recognise there is only one China. This 'civil war' framing is absolutely vital for understanding the potential Western response, or lack thereof."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "Right, the civil war framing. But the US, through the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, committed to considering 'any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means...a threat to the peace and security of the region.' They've supplied Taiwan with sophisticated weaponry for decades. That sounds like more than just observing a 'civil war' from the sidelines, doesn't it? It certainly implies a deterrent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "Indeed, but the operative word there is 'consider.' The US has maintained 'strategic ambiguity' regarding a direct military response. They supply the means for Taiwan to defend itself, but stop short of a firm guarantee. This policy, designed to deter both a Taiwanese declaration of independence and a mainland invasion, is increasingly looking like a relic. As we explored in 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West,' America's capacity and perhaps its will to intervene decisively in distant theatres are not what they once were. The geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting rather dramatically."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "So, the US might not intervene even if Beijing launched a military assault? Given their stated interests in regional stability and democratic values, that seems a monumental capitulation. What makes you so certain they'd stand by, framing it as an internal matter for China?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "The article's argument isn't necessarily about a full-scale amphibious landing. Rather, it focuses on the 'carrot and stick' approach leading to a bloodless reunification. However, even if military force were threatened, the practicalities for the US are daunting. The People's Liberation Army now fields over 2,000 ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan, according to a RAND report. China's military modernisation has eroded the US's ability to project power confidently in the Taiwan Strait. US aircraft carriers and land bases are increasingly vulnerable. The cost-benefit analysis for Washington would be horrific, both in terms of potential losses and the economic fallout, given the immense trade deficit the US has with both China and Taiwan. The Taiwan Straits are effectively already off-limits to the US Navy, strategically speaking."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "I see. So, the 'stick' is that undeniable military might, making overt US intervention too costly. But you mentioned the 'carrot' earlier. How would China, without a shot fired, achieve reunification through incentives? What are these incentives, beyond simply existing as the dominant regional power?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "The 'carrot' is primarily economic. Since 2009, Mainland Chinese investors have been allowed into Taiwan's stock exchange, albeit with a 10% cap, and Chinese tourists can visit. The PRC could dramatically increase these incentives: low-cost loans from mainland banks, preferential market access for Taiwanese companies, and integration into China's vast supply chains and burgeoning domestic market. For Taiwan's business classes, this could be an irresistible offer. We've seen similar patterns of economic absorption and influence in other contexts. Think of China's 'neo-colonial' approach to resource acquisition in Africa, which we discussed in 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' and 'Why Land Deals In Africa Could Make The Great Irish Famine A Minor Event.' Economic leverage is a potent weapon."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "But what about the Taiwanese people themselves? They've enjoyed a vibrant democracy since their first presidential election in 1996. Surely, their democratic aspirations and self-determination would weigh heavily against economic inducements. Are you suggesting democracy simply folds in the face of a sufficiently attractive balance sheet?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "History suggests that economic gravity can, indeed, prove a more potent force than democratic idealism, especially when the alternative is overwhelming military coercion. The article notes the 1992 Consensus, where both sides acknowledge 'one China.' While they disagree on who represents it, the principle is there. For Beijing, it's a matter of time and leverage. They've been remarkably patient. The offer of prosperity and stability, contrasted with the unspoken threat of force and diminishing external protection, can shift public opinion over time, particularly among younger generations and the business elite."

    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "And then there's the elephant in the room: Taiwan's unparalleled role in the global semiconductor industry, particularly TSMC. It produces the vast majority of the world's most advanced chips. If China were to gain control, whether by force or economic inducement, wouldn't that send shockwaves through the global economy and galvanise the US to act, if only to protect its technological supply chains? This isn't just about regional geopolitics; it's about the very engines of the future, as we've discussed in 'The renewables and battery revolution'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "It certainly would, and it's a critical point. However, that very concentration of advanced manufacturing also makes Taiwan a singular target. For China, acquiring TSMC's capabilities would be a strategic coup, vaulting them past current supply chain dependencies. For the US, it's a double-edged sword: a reason to intervene, yes, but also a massive vulnerability. If China takes control, the US doesn't just lose access; China gains it. Diversifying these supply chains is already a US priority, acknowledging the current strategic risk."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "So, the US, burdened by its trade deficit with both China and Taiwan, potentially unable to project decisive military power, and facing crippling economic repercussions if it tried, simply throws in the towel? It sounds like a strategic defeat without a single shot fired. We discuss in 'Why Do We Need The Military? Securing Energy Supplies And Trade Routes' the fundamental purpose of a military force. If it cannot secure critical interests or project power, what then is its point?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "Precisely. The article directly poses that question. The US's strategic position has deteriorated. The RAND report cited in the article underscores China's capabilities in threatening US power projection platforms. The cost of intervention, both financial and in terms of military assets, seems to have become prohibitive. It's a harsh reality of realpolitik, where national interest and capability supersede ideological alignment or historical commitments, particularly when framed as an internal matter."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "Which brings us back to the article's most unsettling question: 'if a one China is inevitable and the People's Republic of China will end up being in control of Taiwan, why is the US continuing to provide sophisticated weaponry to Taiwan?' It's almost as if they're arming China's future military, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "That's the critical defence question, isn't it? If the outcome is indeed perceived as inevitable, then the ongoing transfer of advanced military hardware and know-how to Taiwan, which would then fall under PRC control, appears to be a profound strategic miscalculation, or perhaps merely a legacy policy that hasn't adapted to the new geopolitical realities. It's a policy without a clear, achievable end-game."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "But 'inevitable'? Is anything in geopolitics truly inevitable? What about the broader implications for smaller nations globally, if a democratic, economically vital entity like Taiwan can simply be absorbed by a larger, authoritarian power, with the US effectively acquiescing? Doesn't that set a rather dangerous precedent, emboldening other regional hegemons?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "History suggests that when a dominant regional power consolidates its strength, the absorption of smaller, proximate entities often follows. Think of how Rome gradually brought neighbouring states into its orbit, or the Ottoman Empire extending its reach. When external support for such entities wanes, or becomes too costly, their 'inevitability' often crystallises. It's not a moral judgment, merely an observation of how power has historically been exercised and consolidated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "So, to summarise: the US, through its continued arms sales to Taiwan, is inadvertently equipping an emerging rival, while simultaneously signalling its likely unwillingness or inability to defend Taiwan, thereby paving the way for a bloodless annexation that secures China's technological dominance. A rather perverse form of foreign aid, wouldn't you say?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "An uncomfortable truth, perhaps. The article forces us to confront the stark realities of shifting global power, where historical legacies, economic leverage, and hard military facts increasingly dictate outcomes, often irrespective of democratic aspirations or past commitments. It leaves one pondering what else might be 'inevitable' in the coming decades as the global balance of power continues its dramatic reordering."
