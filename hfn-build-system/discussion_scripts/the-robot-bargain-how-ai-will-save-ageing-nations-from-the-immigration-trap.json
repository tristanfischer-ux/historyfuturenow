  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A trap? That's a bit strong. Are we really comparing modern Western nations to ancient Rome?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Rome faced the same problem. Declining birth rates. Augustus tried tax breaks for parents. Didn't work."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They relied on Germanic *foederati*. Soldiers, then settlers. And by the fifth century, the empire was replaced from within."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The Ottomans were a different beast. And those were religious millets, not just ethnic groups."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The principle of separate identities within a polity holds. Or the British Empire's indentured labour after slavery was abolished."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It created permanent ethnic divisions. Fiji, Trinidad, Guyana. Politics organised along ethnic lines to this day. We've written about it, actually, with China's influence in Africa and the Indian-Kenyans."

    "speaker": "Elena",

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But they preserved social cohesion. Low crime, high trust. No parallel societies or integration debates. They chose machines over migrants."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article suggests the economic argument for mass immigration is already weaker than proponents claim. Data from Finland, the Netherlands shows many groups are a net fiscal cost."

    "text": "[frustrated] That's a convenient reading of the data. It ignores the dynamism, the cultural enrichment—"
  },

    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But if robots do all the work, who earns? How do you distribute wealth? A robot tax? Universal Basic Income? These are massive societal engineering problems."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They are. But the article frames them as 'engineering problems with engineering solutions.' Compared to the social and political fragmentation of every multi-ethnic empire in history?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we accept the machine, maintain cohesion. Or accept the stranger, and tear ourselves apart. That's a brutal framing."
