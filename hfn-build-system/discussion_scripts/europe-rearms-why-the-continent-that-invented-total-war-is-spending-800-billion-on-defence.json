Our latest article, 'Europe Rearms: Why The Continent That Invented Total War Is Spending EUR 800 Billion On Defence,' posits that this is not an isolated event, but the sixth great European rearmament cycle in 400 years. The historical pattern is stark: a devastating war, followed by disarmament, then a new threat emerges, a frantic rearmament, and then either deterrence holds, or war breaks out anew. We've lived through five such cycles since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and the question isn't if Europe should rearm, but whether this time, the pattern can finally be broken."

The article lays out a compelling historical rhythm, from Louis XIV's expansionism after the Thirty Years' War to Bismarck's Prussia triggering the continuous arms race before the Great War. But the most recent 'peace dividend' seems to be the most damning indictment of European foresight. After the Cold War, the continent systematically dismantled its military capacity. Germany reduced its active military from 585,000 in 1990 to 183,000 by 2023. The Netherlands sold its entire tank fleet! It wasn't just cutting back; it was a deliberate destruction of the industrial base. What exactly did we think would happen when we decided serious conflict was 'over for good'?"

    "text": "Precisely. The 'peace dividend' post-1991 wasn't just a reduction in spending; it was an active dismemberment of the very infrastructure required to produce military equipment at scale. Factories closed, skilled workforces retired, and the supply chains atrophied. The consequences became brutally apparent after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. When the EU pledged to deliver one million artillery shells within a year, they couldn't meet it. Rheinmetall, a giant, was producing about 70,000 shells annually, whilst Russia churned out an estimated three million. Our combined GDP is ten times Russia's, yet we're outproduced by a fraction. This isn't just about money; it's about capacity, or rather, the profound lack of it. This echoes the interwar period, when Britain and France allowed their militaries to atrophy, leaving them utterly unprepared for Hitler's rearmament, despite the warning signs."

    "text": "And that's a truly chilling parallel. The article's reference to Germany's defence spending going from 1% of GDP in 1932 to 23% by 1939 is a stark reminder of how quickly a state can re-militarise if it has the political will and an industrial base. But Europe today, as you say, demolished that base. We're not just starting from zero, we're starting from a deficit in many respects, reliant on outsourcing our security. When 78% of European defence procurement was sourced from outside Europe in 2022-2023, with 63% from the United States, it lays bare the hypocrisy of 'European strategic autonomy,' doesn't it? We talk a good game about independence, but we're paying America to arm us."

    "text": "It's a glaring contradiction, undeniably. And this brings us to what the article calls the 'geography of fear.' The commitment to rearmament correlates almost perfectly with a country's proximity to Russia. Poland is spending over 4% of GDP. The Baltic states, with their traumatic memories of Soviet occupation, are between 3% and 6%. Finland, sharing that 1,340-kilometre border with Russia, abandoned decades of neutrality to join NATO. Then, at the other end, you have Spain capping its spending at 2.1%, Italy's budget remaining flat. This uneven commitment creates serious fault lines within the alliance, as it has in every previous cycle. It's reminiscent of the 1930s, where Britain, separated by the Channel, was slower to react to Germany than Czechoslovakia or France, who were directly threatened."

    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "And those fault lines are more than just a matter of percentages, aren't they? A Pole or an Estonian looks at French or German talk of 'strategic autonomy' and sees it, quite rationally, as an invitation to replace a reliable American guarantee with a less reliable, often divergent, European one. This is a critical point that our 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West' article touches on – the internal cohesion of the West. If a crisis truly hits, these divisions over threat perception and commitment could unravel the very unity that's supposed to be Europe's strength."

    "text": "Indeed. The practical challenges are also immense. Europe currently fields 27 separate national armies within the EU. We have 20 different types of main battle tank, where the US operates one. Twenty-nine different naval frigate classes, 12 types of infantry fighting vehicles. This fragmentation means we can't easily share ammunition, spare parts, or logistics. Two European armies on the same battlefield might not even be able to talk to each other. The EU spent EUR 343 billion on defence in 2024, versus Russia's EUR 107 billion, yet Russia gets considerably more fighting power because it has one army, one procurement system, one logistics chain. It's the ultimate example of inefficiency through duplication."

    "text": "It's an absolute bureaucratic nightmare. And the track record for joint European procurement is dismal, as the article highlights. The Eurofighter Typhoon took 23 years from design to full production, billions over budget. The A400M military transport was seven years late and also billions over. Every single European government prioritises its domestic defence industry, local jobs, over pan-European efficiency. Germany wants Leopard tanks built in Germany, France wants Rafale fighters built in France. Until that political incentive changes, this EUR 800 billion is just going to be spread thin across redundant national projects, creating less capability than it should. It's industrial policy, not strategic effectiveness, driving the bus."

    "text": "You raise a critical point about political will overriding strategic logic. However, the article does offer some reasons why this time *might* be different. First, nuclear weapons have fundamentally altered the calculus of great power war. Total war between nuclear-armed states is suicidal, meaning rearmament can sustain a permanent standoff without escalating to open conflict, as we saw during the Cold War. Secondly, the institutional framework is incomparably stronger: NATO and the EU provide coordinating mechanisms that simply didn't exist in previous cycles. Germany and France are rearming together, not against each other. And thirdly, the economic foundation is solid; the EU's combined GDP is over $18 trillion, four times Russia's. We can afford both welfare states and serious defence, if we choose to."

    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "I'm not entirely convinced by that. The Cold War certainly saw deterrence hold, but it also created the 'military-industrial complex' that Eisenhower warned about. Once these structures are built, they develop their own momentum, their own political constituencies. Contractors lobby, generals argue for more capabilities, politicians compete to bring spending to their constituents. It's a ratchet effect; defence budgets go up and rarely come down. What happens to Europe's generous welfare states when hundreds of billions are permanently diverted? France's debt-to-GDP is already over 110%, Italy's over 140%. To find an additional 1.5% to 3% of GDP for defence without cutting something else is, to put it mildly, optimistic. It feels like we're trading one type of security for another, less certain, kind of stability."

    "text": "That's a profoundly uncomfortable truth, and one the article addresses directly under 'What Nobody Is Talking About.' The rearmament will inevitably create pressure on social budgets. But there's also the question of where the threat goes next. This rearmament is premised on Russia. Yet the geopolitical landscape of the 2040s and 2050s will be vastly different. China's military power is growing at an alarming rate, a topic we've explored in 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power. How Does It Compare Historically?' And then there's Africa, whose population is set to double to 2.8 billion by 2050. The Mediterranean could easily become a contested frontier again due to climate change, water scarcity, and population pressure, as we've detailed in 'The North African Threat And Mediterranean Reunification.' The weapons built for one threat are often used for another, as Britain discovered after rearming against Germany, only to face the Soviets."

    "text": "So, are we just building a magnificent military machine designed for the last war, or at best, the current one? A continent investing EUR 800 billion into defence that might be wholly unsuited for the challenges of two decades hence. This isn't just a misallocation of resources; it's a dangerous historical trap. We're responding to a clear and present danger, yes, but without a clear, long-term strategic vision that accounts for these deeper, structural shifts. It feels very much like a reactive scramble rather than a proactive, far-sighted strategy."

    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "That's a fair challenge. However, the article poses a fascinating 'twist' that could fundamentally alter this historical pattern. What if European rearmament, if done correctly, actually *accelerates* European integration? If European nations truly want military capability for their EUR 800 billion, they simply cannot achieve it as 27 separate countries buying 20 different types of tanks. They will be forced to rationalise, standardise, and integrate their defence industries, procurement, logistics, and command structures. They will have to do in defence what they've already done in trade and monetary policy. The article draws a compelling parallel to the United States: the enormous military mobilisations of the Civil War and the World Wars forced the creation of a truly national military, which became one of the most powerful integrating forces in American society. This could be Europe's next step."

    "text": "That's a rather optimistic spin on necessity, isn't it? The idea that spending more money on national armies will suddenly overcome centuries of national self-interest and domestic industrial lobbying. We've seen how difficult even basic joint procurement has been. To suggest that this will force the creation of a 'single defensive force' that's too deeply integrated for any single member to misuse... that seems like a leap of faith. The EU was born from shared steel and coal to prevent war; now we're saying shared tanks will prevent war? It's an attractive vision, but given the perennial squabbling over budgets, regulations, and even foreign policy, how realistic is it to expect a truly integrated European army, where a German general commands French troops with Italian equipment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "A",
    "text": "The article acknowledges it's a 'very big if.' But the logic is compelling: when you're spending 5% of your GDP on security, you simply cannot afford the waste of fragmentation. The economic pressure to consolidate becomes immense. And consolidation in defence tends to spill over into other areas—shared industrial policy, common foreign policy, integrated command and control. This would genuinely break the historical pattern of independent armament leading to suspicion and conflict. It would mean that Europe's sixth rearmament cycle produces something unprecedented: a collective military capability that makes the continent more secure without making it more dangerous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "B",
    "text": "It certainly would. But the question then becomes, can Europe, with all its wealth and institutional sophistication, be wise enough to truly achieve this? Or will it merely repeat the historical pattern, building a larger, more expensive, but ultimately still fragmented and politically constrained military-industrial complex that merely kicks the can down the road to the next inevitable conflict? We've lived our entire lives, as the article points out, inside an anomaly – 80 years of great-power peace in Europe, a wildly improbable historical exception. The EUR 800 billion bill has arrived, and the answer will indeed define the century. But whether it defines it through true integration or through a more elaborate, yet familiar, path to conflict, remains the terrifying unknown."
