    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Naive euphoria that left Europe unable to supply Ukraine with a million shells. Russia produces 3 million a year."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "While Spain caps it at 2.1%. That geographical divide is so frustrating."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It highlights the fault lines. Uneven threat perception. Divisions within the alliance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] And the fragmentation! Twenty-seven armies, twenty different tank types. It's ludicrous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It means Europe gets far less military capability per euro. Seventy-eight percent of procurement from outside Europe, mostly America."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But the scale is different now. Five percent of GDP. You simply cannot afford that waste anymore. Economic pressure will force consolidation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You mean like the US after the Civil War? A truly national military becoming an integrating force? I don't want to agree with you on this, because it feels counter-intuitive to see military spending as a path to unity, but the numbers, and the sheer inefficiency, don't leave much room for any other logical conclusion if they genuinely want an effective defence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The EU was born from sharing steel. Sharing an army could be the next logical step in that same pattern of integration."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But the article also warns: Eisenhower's military-industrial complex. Defence budgets go up, rarely come down. The ratchet effect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A valid concern. And the pressure on welfare states will be immense. Especially with countries like France and Italy already at eye-watering debt-to-GDP ratios."

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It’s not speculation, it’s the pattern. Britain rearmed against Germany, then fought the Cold War. America armed for the Soviets, then Vietnam."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So it's either integrated, stable Europe, or a fragmented one that just reruns the historical cycle with new, unexpected antagonists."
