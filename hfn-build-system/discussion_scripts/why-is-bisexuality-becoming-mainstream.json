  {
    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, let me finish. The data is quite stark. When the reproductive urge is repressed, as they put it, societies shrink."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But you're saying bisexuality is linked to *that*? That's a huge jump."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not directly. But the underlying factors are linked: gender blurring, decoupling sex from procreation, changing social norms."
  },

    "text": "But it's not a moral failing. It's just... people living their lives."

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] \"A direct quote. And it points to a very real demographic phenomenon. Immigrant populations often sustain birth rates.\""
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So your prediction is a return to a more conservative society, driven by birth rates?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not a return. A *shift*. The demographics will change the cultural landscape over time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that ignores the individual. People are still falling in love, forming relationships regardless of 'breeding like rabbits'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Absolutely. But macro trends overpower individual choices in the long run. Look at Ancient Greece. Norms changed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Are you saying bisexuality is just a phase?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps not a 'phase' for individuals, but a societal trend. The article posits a swing back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I don't know... that feels a bit too deterministic. Like people have no agency."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Agency exists, of course. But the collective impact of millions of individual decisions, when driven by underlying structural changes, is powerful."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the mainstreaming of bisexuality is just a temporary blip before traditionalism reasserts itself?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article argues that's the natural demographic consequence. It's not a moral judgment, merely an observation of numbers."

  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. The West's birth rates are historically low. It can't go on indefinitely without significant change."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So we're facing a future where, paradoxically, greater sexual freedom might lead to a more conservative society?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Or at least, a society increasingly shaped by those who adhere to more traditional reproductive patterns."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating, if you think about the implications for equality."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A different kind of unintended consequence, perhaps. Like the article on 'The Unintended Consequences of War' altering women's roles. Change comes in many forms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's just hard to reconcile celebrating sexual diversity with the idea that it's inherently self-limiting."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Nature bats last, Elena. Or, in this case, demographics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the future isn't a continuous march towards progress, but a pendulum swing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Often. History rhymes, as this site always says. Look at Rome's attempts to incentivise birth rates."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And they failed, didn't they?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Largely, yes. Which brings us back to the power of these long-term demographic forces."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, bisexuality is mainstream now, but it might not be in a hundred years, because of who's having children."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
