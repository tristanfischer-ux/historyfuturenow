  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's very optimistic. I'd argue the opposite. More time to exploit, more time to consume. That's why we had 'The Scramble For The Solar System' article, isn't it? Because Earth's not enough."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
