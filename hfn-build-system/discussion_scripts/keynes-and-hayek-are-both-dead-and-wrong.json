    "text": "[sardonic] Harsh, but fair, I suppose. Though I'd argue their underlying principles still have merit, even if the prescriptions are outdated."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that's the point, isn't it? Keynesian stimulus, Hayekian non-intervention... they were designed for a different world. We're applying 1930s solutions to 2020s problems."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "True. The piece does make a compelling case that our structural landscape has shifted too dramatically."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Especially on demographics. Keynes's model relied on a growing young population to pay down debt. We have the opposite, especially in Europe."

    "text": "You mean the 'economically crippled younger population' point? I did wince at that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's not hyperbole. Youth unemployment across the EU is over 25%. In Spain and Greece, it's above 50%. How exactly does a stimulus 'multiplier effect' work when half your young workforce is sitting idle?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] That's a strong counter to the traditional Keynesian argument. A shrinking tax base and a larger dependent population... it does create a debt burden that's almost impossible to pay down."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Exactly. They contribute little in taxes, but take significant amounts in education and support. It's a fundamental demographic mismatch."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I hadn't considered the scale of that demographic reversal quite so starkly. Keynes died at 62; that was old then, but young now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Right. We're living longer, but not necessarily working longer, or having enough children to support it all. It's a looming fiscal catastrophe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Which Hayek would have predicted, in a way. He'd have warned about the unsustainable growth fuelled by cheap credit and political expediency, though perhaps not the demographic angle directly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But doing nothing, as Hayek's purest advocates suggest, isn't an option. The 2008 crash showed us that. A complete financial domino effect was a real possibility."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "True. Hayek's strength was preventing bubbles, not cleaning up the mess after they burst. Politicians just want to be seen to 'do something', which means they'll always lean towards stimulus."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the stimulus just leaks abroad! That's another huge problem the article highlights: the shift in global power and supply chains."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Go on."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A stimulus is supposed to boost domestic demand, creating domestic jobs. But if everyone's buying cheaper products from abroad, the cash just flows out of the economy, boosting *their* jobs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[surprised] Wait, really? The article says stimulus money can actually make Western workers *less* confident, as they see jobs outsourced."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It does. And it makes perfect sense. If you get a stimulus cheque but your company just moved production to Vietnam, you're not exactly feeling secure. You save, not spend."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating for the Keynesian model. A jobless recovery, fuelled by ever-increasing debt."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Precisely. The CBO predicts that by 2025, US interest payments, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will consume 100% of federal tax income. That's 13 years away!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I remember that from our 'Crisis' article. A crisis of declining Western power and increasing internal obligations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, if both are wrong, what then? The article suggests some pretty radical solutions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Managed inflation, for one. To reduce debt levels. It sounds risky, but the piece argues we understand the dynamics better than post-WW1 Germany."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's better than default, which destabilises everything. Inflation makes the numbers add up, without the write-downs. We’ve written about 'Debt Jubilees' before."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Then there's the regional free trade idea. If you want to sell into a bloc, you build factories there. That brings the jobs home. I'm intrigued by that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It forces companies to invest locally. Any stimulus then *actually* stimulates the domestic economy. China does it already, which we discussed in 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] Okay, fine. I'll give you that one. In a world of fragmented supply chains and rising geopolitical tension, that kind of economic regionalisation makes more sense than pure globalism."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the third point, about redirecting military spending. The US spends hundreds of billions on its Pacific fleet, ensuring trade routes with countries it has a massive trade deficit with."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's... an astonishing sum. $400 billion deficit with East Asia alone. And maintaining a fleet for it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's economically irrational. The article suggests spending that money on domestic solar photovoltaics, generating free electricity and hundreds of thousands of jobs. Imagine that stimulus."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] That would certainly be a rather direct application of 'buy local', wouldn't it? From global power projection to domestic energy independence. A profound shift."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's about adapting. The 'renewables and battery revolution' article also makes this point. We have new tools, new challenges. We can't just keep trotting out Keynes and Hayek as gods."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They were brilliant for their time. But our time is defined by shrinking resources, an ageing population, and a radically different balance of power."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And if our leaders don't grasp that, then those CBO projections for 2025 will become a very painful reality. We need new thinking, not old dogma."
