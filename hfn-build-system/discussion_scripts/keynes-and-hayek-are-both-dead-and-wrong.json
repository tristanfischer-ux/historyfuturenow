  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Well, some ghosts are worth listening to. Keynes literally defined modern macroeconomics. Is he irrelevant now?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] Entirely. The world they knew is gone. Both are dead, and their solutions are wrong for our era."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wrong? Hayek predicted the '29 crash, for goodness sake. Low interest rates, speculative bubbles – sounds eerily familiar, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "He did. His diagnosis of bubbles is sharp. But his prescription for a crisis, as the article points out, was 'do nothing'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You can't just 'do nothing' when the financial system is imploding! That's how a recession becomes a depression."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Agreed. The 2008 bailout prevented a domino effect. But that's Hayek's problem: good for prevention, useless for cure. Voters hate inaction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we turn to Keynes then. Stimulus, public works, get people spending. That's the obvious path out, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It worked in the 1930s. Arguably the Second World War was the ultimate Keynesian stimulus. But that's not our world, Elena."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Why not? Borrow money, build infrastructure, create jobs. Multiplier effect kicks in. Simple economics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Simple, yes. Effective, no longer. Not in the West. We have three enormous headwinds Keynes never faced."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Oh, here we go. What are these 'headwinds'?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Demographics first. Keynes lived in a world with a growing, young population. We have shrinking populations, and an ageing one."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But people still work, still pay taxes. They just start later due to education, right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not enough. The article highlights EU youth unemployment averages over 25%. Spain and Greece? Over 50%."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really? Fifty percent?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes. And an increasingly large, retired population drawing pensions and healthcare. They contribute little, take out much."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, that's... a genuine structural issue. I'll give you that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Then there's the environment. Keynes lived in a world of expanding resources – coal, oil, new agricultural land."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And now we're facing peak oil, declining fish stocks. Resource scarcity. That does complicate growth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. Harder to grow when your tide is receding, rather than rising, isn't it? Debts become harder to pay."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the third headwind?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The global balance of power. Western dominance is over. Manufacturing jobs, even high-tech ones, moved East."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] But stimulus is supposed to create *domestic* demand, *domestic* jobs!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Ah. But if that stimulus money then buys cheaper foreign goods, because consumers and companies are cutting costs... where do those jobs go?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You mean... the money just leaks out? It boosts China's economy, not ours?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The 'jobless recovery'. Stimulus without domestic impact. It's why we called it a treadmill earlier."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Okay, that's... actually devastating for traditional Keynesianism. If the multiplier effect largely benefits offshore production..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It makes the debt pile up for nothing. The CBO predicts US interest payments plus entitlements could consume 100% of federal tax income by 2025."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "100%? That's not a treadmill, James, that's a cliff edge. So, what *do* we do then, if both are 'wrong'?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article suggests three things. First, managed inflation. To reduce the real value of that debt."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Inflation? People hate inflation. It eats savings. Weimar Republic, anyone?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "We understand it better now. Controlled inflation, not hyperinflation. The alternative is debt default, which is far more destabilising."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hmm. It's a bitter pill. What else?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Regional free trade. Abandon global free trade. If you want to sell into a region, you build factories there. Like China does to us, actually."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... protectionist. But it *would* keep stimulus money cycling domestically. And force job creation. I can see the logic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Finally, stop exporting cash unnecessarily. Reallocate military spending from securing foreign oil or distant trade routes, and invest it at home."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[surprised] Like the US spending hundreds of billions on its Pacific fleet, while having huge trade deficits with the same region? Or the Middle East?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. Imagine putting that money into domestic solar photovoltaics, as the article suggests. Free electricity for the US, hundreds of thousands of jobs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a provocative thought. It ties into 'The renewables and battery revolution' piece we ran, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It does. Our challenges are systemic. The solutions need to be equally bold, and adapted to the world *now*, not 80 years ago."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the ghosts are still whispering, but we need to stop listening quite so intently. I... actually agree with most of that. Which is unsettling."
