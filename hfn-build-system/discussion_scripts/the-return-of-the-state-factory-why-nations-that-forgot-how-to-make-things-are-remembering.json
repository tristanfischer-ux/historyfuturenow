    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It’s not just stunning, James, it's a complete repudiation. The article describes it as 'mercantilist bargain dressed in the language of free trade'. That's spot on. The orthodoxy is dead, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Absolutely. For forty years, the West was told manufacturing didn't matter. Services, finance, the 'knowledge economy' were everything. Making physical things was for countries with cheap labour. That idea has been thoroughly debunked."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the cost of that delusion has been enormous. You look at the 2.5 million jobs reshored or created in the US since 2010 – 2023 and 2024 seeing record annual totals. It shows the scale of what was lost, and what's now being frantically rebuilt."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. The article rightly calls the period from 1980 to 2015 an aberration. Protectionism, state subsidies, industrial policy – this is the historical norm for any nation that ever became a great power. From the English East India Company to Hamilton's America."

    "text": "Hamilton’s 'Report on Manufactures' in 1791. A foundational document that explicitly rejected Adam Smith. He understood that a young nation couldn't compete, and would remain a raw materials exporter without protection."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The US became the most protectionist major economy for 150 years, with tariffs often between 35% and 50%. And it went from a marginal agricultural economy to the largest industrial power on Earth. Not a coincidence."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Friedrich List saw it too, didn't he? Britain 'kicking away the ladder' – using protectionism to get to the top, then advocating free trade to keep others down. It’s a cynical but accurate reading of history."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Utterly. Britain only became a champion of free trade once the Industrial Revolution gave it an unbeatable advantage. Free trade, in that context, was a weapon, not a philosophy."

    "text": "So, if protectionism built every major power, why did the West abandon it after 1945?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The Cold War. A strategic subsidy, as the article puts it. America traded manufacturing jobs for military alliances. Japan, South Korea, West Germany – they all got preferential access to the US market. Geopolitics trumped economics."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Right, and it made sense then. But the problem was, the Soviet Union collapsed in '91, and the strategy didn't. It became an article of faith. The Washington Consensus. Fukuyama's 'end of history' nonsense."

    "text": "And the admission of China to the WTO in 2001, on the assumption that trade would liberalise its political system. A catastrophic miscalculation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Catastrophic is right. Western companies rushed in, transferred technology, built factories. China didn’t just make cheap toys; it systematically moved up the value chain, backed by massive state subsidies and IP theft."
  },

    "text": "By 2018, China was the world’s largest manufacturer and exporter. The theory of comparative advantage hadn't just failed; it had been weaponised against the nations that believed in it. A point we've explored extensively in our 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' piece."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the consequences of our deindustrialisation are now undeniable. Europe couldn't deliver a million artillery shells to Ukraine. Its combined GDP ten times Russia's, but a fraction of its military output. It wasn't money; it was capacity. The factories were gone."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the return of the state factory isn't a policy fad, it's a correction. Tariffs up to 100% on some Chinese goods. The CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. Billions channelled into domestic manufacturing."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Europe is following, albeit more slowly. The EU's Chips Act, Germany talking 'strategic autonomy.' It's a recognition of reality. And technology is the critical enabler."

    "text": "The disappearing labour cost advantage. If a robot-staffed factory costs roughly the same in Ohio as it does in Guangdong, then why on earth would you build it halfway across the world? This is what we’ve discussed in 'Robotics And Slavery' and 'The Fusion of Revolutionary Technologies'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. AI and robotics are rapidly eliminating that differential. Morgan Stanley predicts 2026 as the inflection point, with companies first automating existing facilities, then building new greenfield sites domestically."

    "text": "So, the 2020s to 2040s will look like the 19th century again? Tariffs, subsidies, state-directed investment. Call it 'strategic autonomy' or 'friend-shoring', it’s mercantilism by another name."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Absolutely. And the nations that rebuild their manufacturing base will become stronger, more resilient. They can arm their militaries, supply their hospitals, create a virtuous cycle of skilled workers, education, innovation."

    "text": "Rome didn't fall because it was poor, but because it outsourced its core capabilities. That's a chilling parallel for any modern state that forgot how to make things."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage won't disappear from textbooks, but it will be taught as a historical curiosity. A theory for a brief, unusual period when one group of nations was so dominant they could pretend the rules didn't apply."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the rules always apply. They just took forty years to reassert themselves, often at immense cost. The factories are coming back."
