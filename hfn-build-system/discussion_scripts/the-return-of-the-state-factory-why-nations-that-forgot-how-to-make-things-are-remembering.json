    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A masterstroke that ultimately hollowed out your industrial base and left you reliant on rivals. The article calls it a 'strategic subsidy'."

    "speaker": "Elena",

    "text": "But Germany's current talk of 'strategic autonomy' or the EU's Chips Act feels defensive, not aggressive like historical mercantilism."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] Defensive often looks a lot like aggressive when you're on the receiving end. Friedrich List called free trade 'kicking away the ladder' for a reason."

    "speaker": "James",

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a direct link to our 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' discussion. They applied mercantilist principles to great effect."

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] Precisely. Europe's GDP is ten times Russia's, but its industrial capacity for defence is a fraction. That's the real cost."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's shocking. We discussed it in 'Europe Rearms' – the continent simply forgot how to produce the basics for defence."

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Some jobs will change, yes. But manufacturing creates a virtuous cycle: skills, innovation, new industries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I worry about the social cost for communities, though. Those 2.5 million reshored jobs since 2010 are good, but what happens when automation takes over?"

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] That's a valid concern. The transition needs careful management. But the alternative was strategic impotence."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "So we're returning to something resembling nineteenth-century industrial policy. Tariffs, subsidies, state-directed investment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Under new names: 'friend-shoring,' 'resilience,' 'strategic autonomy.' It's still mercantilism."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The language shifts, but the underlying historical forces don't. The rules always applied."

    "speaker": "Elena",

    "speaker": "Elena",
