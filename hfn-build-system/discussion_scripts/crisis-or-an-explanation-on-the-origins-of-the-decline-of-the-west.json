    "text": "[dry] We signed a Faustian bargain in 1992, Elena. Not with the devil, but for global dominance, at the cost of our economies. That's the core argument."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A Faustian bargain? That's quite a claim. 1992 was the year the Soviet Union truly collapsed. The West *won* the Cold War. That felt like a triumph, not a bargain with ruin."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. We learned the *wrong* lesson from that victory. We convinced ourselves free markets were inherently superior, always. That's the delusion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But free markets *are* superior to command economies. Look at the USSR's internal tensions, the queues. Communism failed, James. That's a fact."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] Only partially. And timing is everything. Our success predates Marx by 400 years. It had little to do with free markets for most of that."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really? So you're saying capitalism didn't win the Cold War?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I'm saying the *version* of capitalism that won was very different to the one we adopted afterwards. The article makes a strong case for mercantilism."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Mercantilism? Tariffs and monopolies? That's protectionism. That's historically disastrous for consumers, surely?"

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Tell that to Spain after Potosí. Or Britain building its empire via the Navigation Acts. It turned trading prowess into military might."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that's an extractive model, inherently unfair. Adam Smith and David Ricardo argued against it for a reason: comparative advantage benefits everyone."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] Ricardo's theory, published 1817, certainly suited Britain. The first industrialised nation could suddenly make everything better and cheaper."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So you're saying Britain only pushed free trade when it had already won the industrial race?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. They even started the Opium Wars in 1839 to *force* China into 'free trade'. It wasn't a philosophical choice for other nations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating. Forcing markets open. That's not the benign image of free trade we usually hear."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Nor was Commodore Perry sailing into Edo Bay in 1853 to 'open up' Japan. The American School knew this. Hamilton advocated protectionism for infant industries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Right, the Morrill Tariff of 1861. High import duties on British goods. So America, the champion of free markets, started as a protectionist state?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. They used tariffs until 1913, when their own industry was strong enough. Then they became keen proponents of free trade, just like Britain."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I see the pattern forming. Build up your strength behind walls, then demand everyone else tear theirs down once you're dominant."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's the model. The most successful nations used mercantilism until they had an insurmountable advantage. Then they advocated open markets to crush competitors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So the post-1991 'shock therapy' in former Soviet states... that was just opening them up for *our* companies to dominate, not for their own good?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Well, US and European consultants certainly 'descended on credulous government bureaucrats'. The article is unflinching on that point."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That makes so much sense. It explains why China, for example, is so reluctant to fully open its markets now. They're following the old playbook."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They are. Our article 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' explores precisely that. They've learned our history better than we have."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[thoughtful] So the West, after 1992, effectively dismantled its own mercantilist-era protections, believing its own hype about free trade, while rising powers watched and learned?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. We got complacent. We forgot the historical sequence. We believed free trade was an end, not a tool."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a painful insight. We sold off state assets, deregulated. Especially the financial sector."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The 'service sector' took root, generating 'huge profits without the sweat and toil of manufacturing'. Meanwhile, our rivals built their industries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And now we're seeing the consequences. Our industrial base hollowed out, supply chain vulnerabilities exposed. You called it a Faustian bargain."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Twenty-one years later, by 2013, the West appeared weaker than at any time since 1453. The article points to 2001, 9/11, as another pivotal moment too."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Distracting, costly wars... a perfect storm, really. We were too busy fighting other battles while losing the economic one."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. The 'Scramble For The Solar System' will require a very different approach, I suspect, than the one we've been pursuing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, if the West's rise was built on mercantilism, and we abandoned it after our 'victory', what does that mean for our future? Re-armament in Europe, for instance?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[clipped] It means understanding what actually works. Not just repeating mantras. Europe rearming, as another of our articles notes, is a symptom of this shifting balance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So the decline isn't inevitable, but we have to unlearn decades of 'lessons'?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's the challenge. Recognising that 'free markets' aren't always universally good, especially when you're not the dominant player. It's about strategy, not dogma."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And realising we might have gifted our rivals the very blueprint for our own decline. That's a bitter pill."
