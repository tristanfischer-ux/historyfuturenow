    "text": "Choice has a price tag. And it’s one we can no longer afford. The OED first listed 'nuclear family' in 1925. It's barely a century old."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, that's a powerful number. But it doesn't account for the social friction. What about privacy? Individual autonomy?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "You're trading individual autonomy for collective resilience. The article argues big government stepped in to provide what the extended family once did."

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },

    "speaker": "James",

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the solution is for grandparents to become free childcare? And for adult children to provide elder care, taking them out of the workforce?"

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Or enabling them to remain in the workforce because they're not paying exorbitant nursery fees. Or not paying for costly retirement homes."

  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a very neat answer to a very complex social problem. It ignores the emotional toll."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But the economic toll of the current model is bankrupting states. Pensions, unemployment benefits, housing benefits – all huge burdens."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, that's completely wrong. We can find other ways to fund those. Raising taxes, for one, or reining in corporate tax avoidance."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the idea that we can just magic away these costs by moving in together... it's too simplistic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's not magic. It's a return to the historical norm. You said earlier that the Great Recession data was 'necessity.' What if that necessity is becoming the new baseline?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It means people need to work fewer hours, earn less, because their living costs are lower. The article makes that point directly."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] That's the argument. GDP measures money changing hands. If your parents look after your children, GDP doesn't budge. But your household budget certainly does."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The question isn't *if* it happens, but whether politicians will finally acknowledge it."
  },
