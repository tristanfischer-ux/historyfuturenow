  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's not guilt. It's fiscal reality. Your pension in 2060 depends entirely on them. Line item in a budget, not a philosophy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the article itself acknowledges the barriers! Housing, for a start. London housing is 12 times average salary. You can't raise a family in a one-bed flat."

    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And childcare? £14,000 a year for a nursery place in the UK. More than university tuition. That's not a 'choice,' that's a forced decision."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, let me finish. The article says this isn't about blaming individuals. It's about a 'civilisational engine' that's sputtering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Sputtering because we've dismantled the 'village.' Grandparents live 50 miles away. No family support."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",

    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, policies. Like universal childcare, which France did so well for a while."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",

  },

  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A huge ask. But remember what you said earlier about the pension. It's not just a social concern. It's a matter of economic survival."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the innovation collapse you mentioned. Europe and North America's share of global births falling to 5% by 2050. That changes the global balance of power, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It does. As our 'Decline of the West' article explores, the engine sputters. We've certainly seen that with China, haven't we?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
