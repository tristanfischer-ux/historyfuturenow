    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] A rather neat categorisation, I'll grant you. But is it quite so black and white? Hinkley was about securing future energy, after all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It was about securing future *profits* for a globalised elite, funded by the British taxpayer. The article's pretty clear: it's a 'Beam' project through and through."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And the jobs? The local employment for 'Column' workers? That's not a benefit?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A temporary benefit, massively outweighed by the costs. We're talking about a plant receiving more than twice the subsidies renewables get, for over twice as long."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Okay, the economics have certainly soured since the initial projections. No argument there."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Solar power is already the cheapest form of electricity in sunnier parts of the world. In ten years, renewables here will need no subsidies at all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "But the intermittency. That's the persistent challenge with renewables, isn't it? Nuclear offers baseload power."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And battery technology will solve that. For another 35 years after Hinkley's built, British taxpayers will be sending huge subsidies to France and China. It's ludicrous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[clipped] Yet, the Prime Minister at the time approved it. Why? The article says China threatened 'serious consequences' if it was scrapped. That’s geopolitical leverage."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Forget the geopolitical leverage for a second. That's exactly the kind of short-term thinking that led us down this path."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, let me finish. The post-Brexit trade deal with China was paramount for the government. It was a strategic, if unpalatable, calculation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we mortgage our future energy bills to secure a trade deal with a country that, as we've discussed before, shows 'many of the characteristics of an emerging colonial power'?"

  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] A strong claim, Elena. But nations make hard choices. Sometimes you dance with the devil for pragmatic reasons. You know that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But who benefits from that 'dance'? The Beam people who conceived Hinkley, who'll become directors or consultants, the financiers, the lawyers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And the Column people who dig the trenches, pour the concrete. Those are real jobs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Temporary, while their taxes fund a project that undermines their long-term economic security. It's a system rigged against them, as the article concludes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Is 'rigged' not a little strong? Perhaps 'unintended consequences' or 'a failure of long-term foresight'?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] No, it's rigged. The 'Crisis' article talks about decisions not in a country's long-term interest. This is a prime example. The Beam people know this, they just act in their own short-term interest."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I find that indictment rather harsh. They're not necessarily malicious. They operate within a globalised system they helped create."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Malice isn't required for a system to be rigged. Just self-interest without accountability to those at the bottom."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] Okay, fine. The *dynamic* of self-interest overriding broader national good is harder to argue against. Especially when you look at the Hinkley numbers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Exactly. And remember what the article says about Column people? In many areas outside London, 70-90% of all employment is linked to government spending."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[surprised] Wait, really? That high?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Yes. So when you divert massive public funds to a project like Hinkley, those are funds not going to schools, hospitals, or local infrastructure projects that directly benefit Column communities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating for your argument about local jobs, I'll give you that. It's a zero-sum game with those funds."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It is. It's why the 'poor white men fighting to keep rich white men's dominion' parallel from the slavery article resonates here, in a different context. It's about who benefits from the system."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] The article suggests Column people 'need to behave in a more responsible manner.' What does that even mean in this context?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It means recognising the system is rigged and demanding better. Brexit was a crude expression of that anger, a lashing out."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A rather chaotic lashing out, with dubious results for many of those same Column communities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Perhaps. But the sentiment of being left behind, paying for decisions that don't serve them, is real. Hinkley Point is just another flashing sign."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "So, it's not simply an energy decision. It's a symptom of a deeper societal fissure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Precisely. Until the 'Beam' truly understands the 'Column' perspective, we'll keep making these kinds of decisions. And the divide will only deepen."
