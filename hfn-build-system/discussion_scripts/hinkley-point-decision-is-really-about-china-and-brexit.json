    "text": "The Hinkley Point C decision, Elena, wasn't about energy security or a green future. Not really. It was about placating Beijing after Brexit, a naked geopolitical transaction disguised as infrastructure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Oh, come on. That's incredibly cynical, even for you. We need baseload power, James. Nuclear is a proven technology, despite its costs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Proven, perhaps, but at what price? The article argues it’s a Faustian bargain, echoing our piece on the 'Decline of the West'. We're committing to staggering subsidies for 35 years for a technology that's already effectively obsolete."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Obsolete? That's a strong word. Renewables aren't there yet for consistent supply. And the China angle... it's a trade-off. We need new partners post-EU, and China is too big to ignore."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Of course. But the real cost isn't just the £18 billion. It's the opportunity cost, and, more fundamentally, it’s a perfect illustration of what we call the 'Beam' and 'Column' divide."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The Beams and Columns. Right. The globally mobile elites versus the locally rooted."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. Hinkley Point, as the article dissects, was conceived by Beam people. Financiers, consultants, engineers, politicians — all making handsome fees, careers, directorships."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the Column people, presumably, get the jobs digging trenches and pouring concrete? That's not entirely a bad thing, James. Infrastructure projects create employment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "For a time, yes. But who pays? The Column people, disproportionately, through taxes and foregone public services. They’re paying double the subsidy rate of renewables, for twice as long."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really? Double the subsidy? That can't be right. Renewables get huge subsidies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article's quite clear: 'more than twice the amount of subsidies as renewables are given today for over twice the amount of time.' In ten years, solar and wind might require no subsidies at all. But Hinkley will still be on the public purse for decades."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating. If the numbers are that stark..."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They are. It's a classic example of decisions made by a supranational, horizontal elite — the 'Beams' — for their short-term benefit, at the long-term expense of the vertically aligned, place-bound 'Columns'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So it's not just about the cost, but who bears it. And the China threat you mentioned earlier. That's a Beam decision too, isn't it? The pursuit of trade deals regardless of who we're dealing with."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Spot on. The globalists, the free traders, those who see the world as a seamless economic web. They benefit from an open society, from capital flowing freely, from minimal friction."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But isn't that inherently progressive, too? Openness, international cooperation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not necessarily. The article points out the contradictions. Many Brexiters, ostensibly nationalists or 'Closed', are fiercely pro-free trade, even unilaterally. While others, also 'Closed', fear free trade for job losses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's a mess, then. The traditional left-right divide is dead, we know that. Brexit proved it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Absolutely. It united 'Left wing working classes' with 'Right wing land owners' against what they perceived as a distant, unaccountable elite. Sound familiar?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It does. And Hinkley just reinforces that feeling, doesn't it? That the system is rigged."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. The article explicitly states: 'Trump's improbable rise and the UK's crazy decision to leave the EU happened because of a growing feeling amongst Column people that the system is rigged against them. Hinkley is just another reminder that they are right.'"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, I'll grant you the point on the optics, and maybe the raw financial figures for Hinkley are worse than I'd realised. But the idea of these 'Beams' being inherently detached, almost uncaring... I struggle with that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not uncaring, perhaps. Just rational. Their self-interest, given their mobility and global exposure, aligns with policies that often undermine the competitiveness of their home nations. It's not malice; it's structure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that leads to a kind of neocolonialism, doesn't it? Like our analysis of China in Africa, where external powers extract resources or wealth, and the local population suffers the long-term consequences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A fascinating parallel. The Hinkley decision itself, remember, was influenced by China's threat. That's a power dynamic straight out of the 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' playbook. We're on the receiving end this time, ironically."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we're stuck in this cycle where the Beams make these deals that serve their interests, but then the Columns rebel, and we get more instability. It feels like we're just repeating history's mistakes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. The Marquis de Lafayette, Thomas Jefferson – Beam people of their era, shaping revolutions. But even then, the benefits often accrued to certain strata, leaving others behind. History, as we always say, rhymes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So what do we do? Just accept this fundamental split?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article suggests that 'Column people need to behave in a more responsible manner'. A provocative thought, wouldn't you say?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, that's completely wrong, and I'll tell you why. That shifts the blame! It's not about Column people behaving 'more responsibly' when they're the ones being systematically disadvantaged by decisions made over their heads."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I think the implication is that they need to understand the structural forces better, and perhaps advocate for their interests more effectively, rather than just reacting. Not blaming, but empowering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hmm. I don't know, James. It sounds a bit like telling the victim to try harder. The Beams, with all their education and influence, are the ones making the decisions that lead to these disparities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They are. And they're not necessarily malicious. The article posits they're doing what is in their 'best short term interest'. The incentives are aligned that way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that's the tragedy, isn't it? That individual, rational choices by the powerful aggregate into something deeply detrimental for the majority. And Hinkley Point, with its outrageous subsidies to China and France, is just another exhibit A."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A very expensive exhibit. One that suggests the UK, post-Brexit, is far from 'taking back control' if it's still making such desperate concessions."
