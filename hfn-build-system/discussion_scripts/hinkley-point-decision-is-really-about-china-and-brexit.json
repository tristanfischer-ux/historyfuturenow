    "text": "The Hinkley Point C decision. An £18 billion nuclear power station, largely funded by China. It strikes me as a monument, Elena, to how immediate political imperatives can entirely eclipse long-term national interest."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "An £18 billion monument, perhaps, or a very expensive Faustian bargain. As our article points out, the price has more than doubled since conception, and the technology looks increasingly risky. Why on earth did the government push it through?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Because, as the article reveals, China threatened the UK with 'serious consequences' if the project was scrapped. Post-Brexit, the perceived need for a free trade deal with Beijing was deemed paramount. National energy strategy took a back seat to geopolitical leverage."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, economic diplomacy over energy security? That's quite a trade-off. It sounds like a textbook example of our 'Beam' people making decisions that benefit a supranational agenda, rather than the 'Column' majority back home."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The article posits this 'Beam and Column' divide as a more useful lens than the traditional Left-Right spectrum. Beam people, horizontally aligned across nations, fluent in English, working in the non-physical service sector. Their loyalties are often diffuse."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And Column people? Vertically aligned. Their lives and opportunities tied intrinsically to their home country, often in physical industries or public services. They’re the ones who feel the direct impact of these decisions, often negatively."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. Hinkley Point was conceived by Beam people, for Beam people. Financiers, lawyers, engineers, politicians — all stand to make significant short-term gains. The long-term costs, the huge subsidies to France and China, fall squarely on the Column taxpayers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And this is where the resentment festers, isn't it? The sense that the system is rigged against them. It’s what drove the Brexit vote, what propelled Trump. Hinkley Point is just another very visible reminder."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. Our article on the 'Decline of the West' touches on this. When a significant portion of the population feels alienated, believing their leaders are acting against their interests, the social fabric begins to fray."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But let's be blunt: renewables are now significantly cheaper than nuclear. Solar and wind, coupled with battery technology for intermittency, could have been funded for a fraction of Hinkley's cost, without sending billions abroad for decades."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The irony isn't lost. Nuclear, despite 50 years of operation, now requires lavish subsidies — more than twice what renewables receive, for more than twice the duration. It’s no longer commercially viable on its own."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the article makes a crucial point: these funds, those billions, could have gone into schools, hospitals, pensions. Things that directly benefit the Column population. Instead, it's a massive wealth transfer to foreign entities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A transfer, I might add, to a nation like China, which our other analysis, 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power,' suggests is increasingly leveraging its economic power in ways that challenge existing global norms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we're essentially paying a colonial power, as you put it, to build our critical infrastructure? And giving them a huge foothold in our energy grid? That's not just economic; it's a strategic vulnerability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "One could argue the Beam contingent making these decisions are so globally minded, so detached from traditional national loyalties, that such strategic implications are either downplayed or simply not within their frame of reference."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a disturbing thought. It implies a deliberate, or at least indifferent, undermining of national competitiveness. The article states it plainly: Beam people routinely undermine their home countries' competitiveness, disproportionately impacting Column people."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Think of the agricultural subsidies within the EU, for instance. 53% of farm income in the UK is subsidy. Remove that, and many Column-based farms would collapse. These are the people tied to physical land, physical work."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Right, and Beam people, with their international portfolios and global mobility, don't feel the pinch of those lost jobs or the erosion of local economies. They simply move their capital, or themselves, elsewhere."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It echoes the themes we explored in 'Robotics And Slavery' or 'The Immorality of Climate Change' – where long-term societal costs are externalised or ignored for short-term gains, creating a system that advantages a few at the expense of many."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, Hinkley Point isn't just a bad energy deal, it’s a symptom. A symptom of a fundamental rift in society, where one group makes decisions based on an entirely different set of incentives and loyalties than the other."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And it’s a rift that’s widening. The article’s closing line is quite stark: 'Column people are not stupid either. Trump’s improbable rise and the UK’s crazy decision to leave the EU happened because of a growing feeling amongst Column people that the system is rigged against them. Hinkley is just another reminder that they are right.'"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's the key point, isn't it? The perception isn't just perception. There's real data behind it. Real billions being siphoned off, real jobs not being created, real future liabilities being incurred."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. The Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson, both Beam people of their era, were comfortable crossing borders and engaging with foreign revolutions. This isn't a new phenomenon, but its scale and impact on a globally interconnected economy are."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the modern Beam person has even fewer ties. They'll wave the national flag at the World Cup, but might retire anywhere with better weather and cheaper wine. Loyalty is a commodity, not an innate condition."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Which leaves the Column people to pay the bills, both economic and social. The erosion of trust, the feeling of disenfranchisement. It's a dangerous path."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, what's the solution then? How do you reconcile these fundamentally divergent interests when the very architects of policy are part of the problem?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article's suggestion, that 'Column people need to behave in a more responsible manner,' is a start. But it implies a level of agency that feels, at times, out of reach for those disempowered by these 'Beam' decisions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It feels a bit like blaming the victim, doesn't it? When the rules of the game are set by one group, and the other is simply reacting to the consequences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But without understanding the structural forces at play, the incentives driving these decisions, we're simply left with a string of seemingly irrational choices, like Hinkley, that ultimately undermine stability."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And that instability, as we've seen with Brexit and other global shifts, has very real, very disruptive consequences. Hinkley Point, then, isn't just about electricity; it's about the future of national cohesion."
