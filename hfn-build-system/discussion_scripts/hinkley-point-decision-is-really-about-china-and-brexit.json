    "speaker": "James",

  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a bit simplistic, isn't it? Dividing society into global elites and local workers. It feels like a caricature."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Is it? The article cites British people with American degrees working for Arabian banks in Dubai. Or Pakistanis from Stanford working for Citigroup then the World Bank."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, if you travel for work, you're a Beam? If you stay put, you're a Column? That can't be the entire story."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] It's about outlook and economic ties. Beams benefit from free flow of capital and people, often undermine home country competitiveness. Columns are tied to place, to local economies, to government spending."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I can see the distinction, especially when you talk about the 70-90% of jobs outside London linked to government funds. That's... actually quite devastating."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes. And those Column people are the ones paying the Hinkley Point subsidies. Funds that could have gone to their schools or hospitals."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] But there's a national strategic need! We can't just rely on solar and wind when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. Baseload is critical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Right. But ten years to build it? In ten years, renewables will likely need no subsidies at all. Battery technology will fix intermittency. The article makes that clear."

    "text": "Wait, really? No subsidies?"
  },

    "speaker": "James",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, that's harder to argue with. If the numbers are so stark, why did they go ahead?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Because Beam people conceived it. Politicians, engineers, financiers, lawyers. All making good money from it. It's in their short-term interest."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So you're saying it's pure self-interest, disguised as national interest?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article's pretty blunt: 'Beam people know this. They are well educated and informed. They are doing something that is in their best short term interest but is not in the best interest of their country and their fellow citizens in the long run.'"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a damning indictment. It links directly to why so many feel the system is 'rigged,' as the article states."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. Trump, Brexit. These weren't accidents. They were a reaction from Column people. Remember when you called those voters 'seemingly unconnected'? Hinkley helps us connect them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I suppose... the idea of paying subsidies to France and China for decades, for something cheaper alternatives exist for now, and will dominate later... that's a tough sell."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a particularly tough sell when you consider other countries are already outmanoeuvring us. China, for instance, in our 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' piece."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So Hinkley isn't just a bad deal financially, it's also a symbol of how the Beam mindset undermines national sovereignty, or at least national wealth, over the long term."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. Just as the Treaty of Tordesillas in 'The Scramble For The Solar System' was ignored by rising powers, these long-term commitments can prove incredibly shortsighted."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It feels like a slow, self-inflicted decline. Like in your 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West' article."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The Faustian bargain. Short-term knowledge, long-term soul. Or in this case, short-term contracts, long-term burden."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the Column people, who are not stupid, will keep noticing. That's the real issue, isn't it? The erosion of trust."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes. When the system appears rigged, as it does with projects like this, eventually the Column people push back. And that pushback often isn't rational or predictable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, what's the solution? Forcing Beams to act more responsibly? Or empowering Columns to make better decisions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[amused] Good luck with both. But understanding the divide is the first step. Hinkley Point simply highlights how deep it runs."
