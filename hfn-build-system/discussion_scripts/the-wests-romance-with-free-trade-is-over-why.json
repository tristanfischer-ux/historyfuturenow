    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Oh, come on. That's incredibly cynical. Free trade lifted millions globally, you can't deny the benefits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Did it, or did it just redistribute wealth more effectively for whoever was winning at the time? The historical arc is telling."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Telling how?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "From the 1400s, it was mercantilism. States granting monopolies, like the East India Company. Violently anti-competitive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that's ancient history. We evolved beyond that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Did we? The British only championed free trade after their Industrial Revolution. They could produce everything cheaper."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[surprised] You're saying Adam Smith and Ricardo were just... a smokescreen?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not entirely, but their ideas aligned perfectly with Britain's economic dominance. Free trade became an extension of mercantilism, just with a different mechanism."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a convenient reading of history, James."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] Convenient, perhaps, but effective. They used force to break into markets. Think the Opium Wars in 1839. China didn't want their opium, Britain sent the Royal Navy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating. A stark reminder of colonialism's underbelly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. Then the US took up the mantle after WW1, pushing free trade when they dominated sectors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that was different. That wasn't about forcing markets open with gunboats. It was about creating a global system."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A system that started to fray when Japan and West Germany began producing better, cheaper goods in the 1980s. Protectionist sentiments emerged."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But then the Soviet Union collapsed, and China joined the WTO in 2001. That ushered in a golden age of sorts, didn't it? A genuine win-win."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "For a while, yes. Cheap goods for the West, jobs for China. The classic Ricardian comparative advantage."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Exactly! Millions lifted out of poverty. That's the real story."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Until it turned into a gigantic trap, as the article puts it. Western companies trained the Chinese, transferred IP, often forcibly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] But those companies went in knowing the terms! They chased the market, willingly. You can't blame China for playing the long game."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And for industrial espionage. We've seen this before, haven't we? Our article 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' explores this too."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You're comparing China's current actions to historical colonialism?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They lost their monopolies on silk in 552 AD, porcelain in the 1700s, tea in the 1800s. All stolen. Now they're doing the reverse."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait. You're saying China is just giving the West a taste of its own historical medicine?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] The historical echoes are undeniable. China's 'Made in China 2025' policy aims to dominate high-value sectors: AI, EVs, biotech. No more sticking to low-cost goods."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the theory of comparative advantage... it's breaking down. China's not just making our cheap plastic toys anymore."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's the world's largest manufacturer and exporter. $12.7 trillion economy in 2019. Exports jumped from $21 billion in 1980 to $2.49 trillion by 2017. They're winning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually very hard to argue with. The numbers are stark."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Hard to argue with. The West's 'luck' is indeed running out, as another of our articles states."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So Trump's tariffs, Europe's blocking Chinese acquisitions... it's not just economic nationalism. It's an admission free trade isn't working for us anymore."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a return to self-interest. The 'romance' ends when the partner starts out-competing you across the board."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the implications for the global balance of power are... immense. More trade wars, then?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "If history is a guide, yes. The 1400s had their own version of trade protection. We're just swapping spices for silicon chips."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a rather bleak outlook, James. For everyone."
