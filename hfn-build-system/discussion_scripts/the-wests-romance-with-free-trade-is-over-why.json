    "text": "This whole framing that the West's free trade 'romance' was just a cynical power play? I think it downplays the actual economic benefits and genuine belief in its principles."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] 'Genuine belief' often aligns perfectly with self-interest, Elena. The article points out Britain only became a militant free trader after the Industrial Revolution. Coincidence?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the data on global poverty reduction is staggering since the WTO era. Free trade lifted hundreds of millions out of destitution, particularly in Asia. That's not just a cynical side effect."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A valid point. But the article's core argument is that free trade is fantastic... when you're winning. Britain was winning in the 1800s; America was winning post-WWII."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, it was always a temporary strategy, not an enduring philosophy? I struggle with that. Ricardo's comparative advantage felt like a universal truth."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Well, the West's initial mercantile period, from the 1400s, was certainly not about universal truths. It was about exclusive monopolies, like the East India Company."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Yes, but Smith and Ricardo genuinely challenged that. They saw mercantilism as stifling innovation, creating artificial scarcities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[amused] And then Britain used its industrial might to smash open markets, often violently, as with the Opium Wars. Was that Smith's vision?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, of course not. That was a horrific chapter. But you can't blame free trade itself for colonial abuses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article suggests free trade became an *extension* of mercantilism for Britain. Just a more efficient way to dominate. The end goal remained similar."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hold on. If it was just about dominance, why did it last so long? And why did so many developing nations buy into it too, like China joining the WTO in 2001?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They bought into it because it offered growth, which it did. But China also had its own long-term strategy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A strategy of state-backed competition? Or industrial espionage, as the article details?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[clipped] Both. And forced intellectual property transfer through joint ventures. Western companies agreed, lured by market access."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a massive failure of Western corporate strategy, then. Not solely a flaw of free trade doctrine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But it demonstrates that when another player starts winning, the rules suddenly change. The US is now responding with tariffs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we're simply reverting to protectionism. That feels like a dangerous path, reminiscent of the 1930s."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article argues it's less a reversion, more an acknowledgement of historical cycles. Mercantilism to free trade, and now back again."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But isn't that just a race to the bottom? If everyone protects everything, global trade shrinks. Consumers lose out on cheaper goods."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "True, but Western manufacturing jobs have been decimated. The 'low-cost goods' argument doesn't fully account for that social cost, does it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You're right, the 'win-win' narrative ignored the impact on specific industries and communities. That's fair."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And now China isn't just producing 'low-value goods'. Their 'Made in China 2025' policy targets AI, EVs, biotech. High-value sectors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating for the comparative advantage theory. If they can do everything, where does that leave everyone else?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] It leaves us re-evaluating our strategic interests. Just as Britain did in the 1800s, and America did after the World Wars."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I don't want to agree with you on this, but the numbers on China's economic growth and export dominance — $12.7 trillion GDP in 2019 from $305 billion in 1980 — they don't leave much room to argue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. This isn't about being 'fair'. It's about securing national wealth and power. As 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' also suggests."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the West's current protectionist shift is less about ideology and more about survival in a new economic reality."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. A realisation that 'The Rise of the West Was Based on Luck' and that luck, or at least our competitive edge, has run out in certain sectors."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But what about our own historical hypocrisy? Smuggling silk worms, reverse-engineering porcelain, stealing tea plants from China. We did the exact same thing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] A fair point, Elena. The pot calling the kettle black, perhaps. But that doesn't make China's current actions any less threatening to Western industry."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It means the West has to accept its own historical role in shaping these ruthless trade dynamics. We set the precedent."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And now we're living with the consequences. The question is, can we adapt without sparking a full-blown global trade war?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's the difficult part. Because if it's just a return to aggressive mercantilism, the future looks very unstable."
