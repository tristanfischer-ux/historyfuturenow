    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Yes, but that was about resource extraction. This is about job displacement, a different beast."

  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not entirely. Ricardo's 'comparative advantage' and Smith's 'free trade' crushed non-industrialised economies. China, India... they had their industries destroyed by cheap Western goods."

  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article suggests companies will hire smart, hardworking people from anywhere on Earth before those locally. It's a brutal economic reality, not a moral judgement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that leads to massive social instability. The French Revolution, the 1848 upheavals... those were caused by joblessness and despair."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Exactly. The first Industrial Revolution took 150 years to settle. Europe was convulsed. It wasn't a quick transition."

  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It means the pressure builds internally. Societal friction. Not just in one country, but everywhere simultaneously."
