    "speaker": "James",

    "text": "[thoughtful] I understand the historical precedent of national defence, James. And the scale of displacement you're talking about – hundreds of millions – does shift the calculus for governments faced with feeding their own populations. I don't like it, not one bit, but I can see how such unthinkable positions could become grim necessities if the alternative is internal societal breakdown."
