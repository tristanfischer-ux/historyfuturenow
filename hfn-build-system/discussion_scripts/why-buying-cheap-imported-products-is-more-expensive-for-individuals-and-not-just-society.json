    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "An illusion? James, millions in the West rely on those cheaper products. And we can't ignore the millions lifted out of poverty in Asia by this very system. Are you suggesting we reverse decades of global economic progress for... what, exactly?"

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. Consider the UK. An average worker pays, what, £6,384 in income tax annually. Our current unemployment rate sits around 7.6%. That costs us £67 billion a year in benefits and lost tax revenue."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a lot, but unemployment has many causes. You can't just pin it on imports."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, but it's a significant contributing factor. When manufacturing and service jobs migrate East due to lower labour, land, and construction costs, fewer jobs remain here. It's not rocket science. Comparative advantage, as economists love to cite, simply isn't working as advertised."

  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's enough, hypothetically, for each worker to buy 149 of those EU-made, slightly more expensive laser printers every year instead of the Chinese ones, without busting their budget. The 'cheap' saving is utterly dwarfed by the unemployment cost."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, that's... actually devastating. But that's the UK. What about the EU average?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It gets much worse. The EU17 average unemployment rate in 2013 was 12.1%. If the UK had that, the cost would be £107 billion. 59% of all personal income tax would go to funding the unemployed. That's 2.2 months of income."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The numbers are in the article, straight from Eurostat data, translated into UK context. And if we look at countries like Greece, with 27.3% unemployment... the cost to UK taxpayers would be £242 billion. That's more than the average worker even pays in tax!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, that's completely wrong, and I'll tell you why. You're isolating one factor – the cost of benefits – and ignoring the huge economic value generated by global trade. Businesses thrive, new industries emerge, and the overall pie grows larger. This isn't a zero-sum game."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Is it? Because our article, 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West', rather strongly suggests otherwise. It feels very much like a zero-sum game when the wealth transfer is so colossal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But what about the global south? The millions lifted out of poverty? The argument for open markets has always been that it's a net good for humanity, even if there are some dislocations in developed economies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A 'net good'? For the West, this particular brand of 'good' means transferring hundreds of billions of dollars annually to the East. The US, for example, spends $137 billion a year on its military in the Pacific, securing trade routes. Yet it loses $400 billion a year in trade deficits to Asian countries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... securing trade routes is a global public good. And the trade deficit isn't solely about manufactured goods, it's complex."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It amounts to a staggering $537 billion a year for the US. That's $1,700 per American man, woman, and child. You're talking about global good, I'm talking about a budget-busting drain that leads to 'mindboggling private, commercial and government debt.' This isn't just theory, Elena, it's the very core of our economic instability."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hold on—"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And while we're talking about the global good, don't forget the pollution aspect. Cleaner Western factories are replaced by Asian ones powered by coal, producing 'dirtier' byproducts. Remember our piece on 'The immorality of climate change'? This isn't a sustainable model on any front."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, the environmental point is fair. The data on Western job losses and the sheer cost of unemployment here, domestically... I don't want to agree with you on this, but the numbers don't leave much room to manoeuvre."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. The true cost of that 'cheap' imported product isn't just the price tag. It's the tax hike you face to support your unemployed neighbour, the stagnating wages, the lack of opportunities for your children."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Youth unemployment rates in the EU are terrifyingly high. If you can't find a job now, your future prospects are significantly diminished. That's a long-term societal scar."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. This system isn't just transferring wealth, it's creating future social liabilities. We're effectively subsidising other nations' industrial growth while eroding our own."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, if the companies know this, and individuals can't see the connection, why do politicians and economists promote it? That's the real mystery, isn't it? The article asks why, and I'm still left wondering."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "They ought to know better. Our article suggests that perhaps 'Keynes And Hayek Are Both Dead, And Wrong' in their current applications. The globalised model, divorced from national interest and long-term societal cost, is failing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It just feels so... intractable. How do you roll back decades of this kind of integration without causing an even bigger shock?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's the £242 billion question, isn't it? As we've discussed in 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power', the landscape has irrevocably shifted. The West has effectively outsourced its future."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And we're left to foot the bill. It makes sense why corporations push it, of course. They see tax as a cost, not a social obligation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Quite. They transcend national boundaries, while our citizens remain tied to national tax and welfare systems. The disconnect is stark."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I suppose the only argument left is that without cheap imports, the cost of living would go up for everyone, making even more people dependent on benefits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A valid point, certainly. But if that 'extra' cost of domestically produced goods is offset by a substantial reduction in your tax burden due to full employment... is it really more expensive? That's the core question our analysis asks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It means reframing how we perceive 'cheap' entirely. Thinking about the actual cost of a product as a lifetime investment in your society, not just a transaction."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. A penny saved on a widget, a pound lost on the dole queue. Which is the real bargain?"
