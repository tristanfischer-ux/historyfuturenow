    "text": "Only if you ignore the hidden costs to society. The article makes a very strong point: that 'cheap' printer might cost you £15 less upfront, but it costs the taxpayer far more."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Not all, but a significant chunk. Manufacturing jobs moved to Asia. Service sector jobs too. That leaves fewer jobs here."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Absolutely. In October 2013, the EU17 average unemployment rate was 12.1%. Greece and Spain were at 27.3% and 26.7% respectively. That's devastating."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Those numbers are indeed stark."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Now, let's talk about the cost of that unemployment. For every person out of work, the UK taxpayer covers benefits and loses out on taxes."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article uses a figure, I recall. What was it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "£27,184 per annum. That's the cost of benefits paid plus the lost income tax from one unemployed person."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "So, we're essentially subsidising unemployment by buying cheaper imports."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Precisely. The UK's 2.5 million unemployed in 2013 cost £67 billion a year. That's 35% of an average worker's income tax."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] That's a lot of printers. Or rather, a lot of tax that *could* be spent on other things, or simply returned to workers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Imagine if that £2,236 wasn't going to unemployment benefits but back into workers' pockets. That's 1.3 months of additional salary a year."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I see the point. It's a compelling calculation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It gets worse. If the UK had Greece's 27.3% unemployment rate, it would cost £242 billion. That's more than the average worker pays in tax."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating. That budget would be annihilated. A sum higher than defence, education, and health combined."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Exactly. We're talking about a fundamental decline, a 'Crisis' for the West if you will, as one of our other articles puts it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Okay, fine. I'll give you that the direct fiscal cost of unemployment is far higher than any individual saving on a product."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But it's not just the direct cost. What about the geopolitical implications?"
  },

    "speaker": "James",

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The article mentions the US spending $137 billion a year on its military in the Pacific to secure trade routes for these 'cheap' goods."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes, to maintain freedom of navigation. Standard naval doctrine."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that 'secured' trade leads to a $400 billion annual trade deficit with Asian countries for the US. A direct transfer of wealth."
  },

    "speaker": "James",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's $537 billion total, or $1,700 per American, man, woman, and child. It contributes to their national debt."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's a powerful point. I hadn't considered the military-economic loop in such stark terms. It makes the 'China as an emerging colonial power' thesis even more concerning."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And we haven't even touched on the environmental cost. We exported our pollution along with our jobs."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] You mean cleaner Western factories closing, replaced by coal-fired Asian ones?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Precisely. The 'immorality of climate change' isn't just about carbon numbers. It's about where those emissions are happening because of our consumption habits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I suppose that's a negative externality that's very difficult to price into a product, yet it's undeniably there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, when we consider the full life-cycle cost—unemployment, lost tax revenue, military spending, and environmental degradation—that 'cheap' product becomes ridiculously expensive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It does. It's a short-sighted bargain, trading immediate gratification for long-term national decline. Reminds me of the Faustian pact we discussed in 'Crisis: Decline of the West'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Exactly. And the biggest mystery of all is why so many Western politicians and economists continue to promote this system, despite the evidence."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Short-term political gains versus long-term structural shifts. It's a tough sell to tell people to pay more."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But if we don't, the bill will just keep getting higher, in ways most people don't connect to their shopping trolleys."
