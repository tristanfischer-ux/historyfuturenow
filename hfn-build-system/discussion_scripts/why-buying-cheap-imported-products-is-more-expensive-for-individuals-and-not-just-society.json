    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Oh, come on. That's a classic misdirection. Consumers aren't thinking about national unemployment figures when they're trying to afford a printer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps they should be. Our analysis shows that a significant chunk of every working Briton's income tax – around 35% – goes to fund unemployment, fuelled in part by those 'cheap' imports."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Thirty-five percent? That's... quite a claim. You're attributing all of that to imports?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[clipped] Not all, no. But the article's modelling suggests if the UK had the EU17 average unemployment rate of 12.1%, nearly 60% of income tax would be eaten by benefits."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really? That's almost two-thirds. That feels... unsustainable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] It is unsustainable. This isn't just about jobs moving East; it's about the life-cycle cost. Like your 'cheap' printer needing absurdly expensive ink cartridges."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a cynical analogy. People buy what they can afford. Companies outsource to remain competitive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And the cost of that 'competitiveness' is transferred directly to the taxpayer. The article estimates it costs the UK £67 billion per year for its current 7.6% unemployment."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But isn't this simply comparative advantage at work? Countries specialise, everyone gains."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Does comparative advantage explain 27.3% unemployment in Greece? Or 26.7% in Spain? Ricardian theory doesn't seem to be working, does it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] Those are crisis economies, James. You can't extrapolate those figures to the entire West."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I'm not. But the underlying mechanics are the same. Youth unemployment is even worse across the EU. If you can't find a job now, your future prospects are—"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Yes, but we still get cheaper goods. My £100 printer from China costs £115 to build here. That's a 15% saving for me, right now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That £15 saving costs you £2,236 a year in tax for unemployment. Or potentially much more."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a simplification. You're saying my individual purchase directly correlates to a specific unemployed person, which isn't how it works."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, it's a systemic cost. The collective effect is what matters. We've written extensively on the 'Decline of the West', and this is part of it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, we should all pay more for everything? Just to create jobs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "We already *are* paying more. Just not at the checkout. We're paying through our taxes, through overstretched budgets, or through increased government borrowing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That... is harder to argue with than I expected."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Imagine if the UK faced Greece's unemployment rate. We'd have 8.9 million people out of work. The cost to taxpayers would be £242 billion a year."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hold on— £242 billion? Annually?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes. And for context, that's more than our entire defence, education, and health budgets *combined*."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating. That single number changes the whole equation. That's not just a 'hidden cost'; that's an existential threat to public services."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The article calls it 'mindboggling private, commercial and government debt' for the US too, partly from trade imbalances and securing supply lines."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You mean like the $537 billion the US spends annually on its military in the Pacific, partly to secure trade routes for goods they then import at a loss?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "You've read that 'Why do we need the military?' piece. It's all connected. We are, in effect, subsidising our own decline."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, politicians promoting this system... are they just blind to these full-cycle costs? Or worse?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article asks why they promote it, given the 'gigantic transfer of wealth to the East'. Perhaps they're just not doing the maths."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But corporations benefit. They cut costs, increase market share. They don't care about the externalities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No, they don't. Their remit is shareholder value, not societal well-being. That's a government's job."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Which brings us back to those politicians. Why are they allowing this? It's like voluntarily choosing the printer with the insanely expensive ink."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] Or like Doctor Faustus making a bargain. Short-term gain for a long-term, devastating price."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I still think individual choice matters, but the scale of the societal cost you've laid out... I hadn't seen it presented like that. It's not just about 'cheap', is it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No. It's rarely just about 'cheap'. The future always presents a bill."
