    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But the article asks if it was 'spectacularly stupid, irresponsible and short sighted.' A strong case, I think."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Stupid? Or unavoidable? We want access. They want technology. It's a negotiation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A negotiation where one side thinks in five-year increments and the other in fifty. That's the difference."

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, that's completely wrong. The Romans were weakened by devastating plagues! That's a huge factor. The West isn't facing a plague wiping out half its population."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Not plague, no. But our demographic decline is very real. Our political short-termism, compared to China's '5 to 50 year time horizons'?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Ah, the African land grabs. You mentioned that before. So, the West gives away its tech, and China buys up the world's resources."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. We arm them for economic battle, and they fuel their economic engine with our resources. It's a double play."

  },

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And China, meanwhile, just keeps building. Like those 'renewables and battery revolution' articles, they're dominating that too."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. They're leveraging technology, scale, and long-term vision. While we're still selling off the family silver."
