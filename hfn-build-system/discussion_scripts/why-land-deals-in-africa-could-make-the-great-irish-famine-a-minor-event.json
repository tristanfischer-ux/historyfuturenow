    "text": "[surprised] Good heavens. That's a staggering amount of land."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the historical parallels with the Great Irish Famine are chilling. That famine wasn't about a lack of food, James. Ireland was a net exporter throughout."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The blight was the trigger. The *system* was the killer. Absentee landlords, export-focused production, and a disempowered local population."

    "text": "Oakland Institute and Land Matrix data suggests 66% of these modern deals are in countries with high levels of hunger. And most projects are export-oriented."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "So you're saying it's pure exploitation, a simple repeat of history?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I'm saying the structural conditions are alarmingly similar. Foreign investors – pension funds, university endowments – are absentee landlords by another name."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's a stretch. They're seeking returns, not enacting colonial policy."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But they're acquiring water rights, displacing smallholders. AgriSol Energy's plan in Tanzania would have evicted 160,000 long-term residents. Think about that."

  {
    "speaker": "Elena",

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] I'll grant you that the scale of potential displacement is concerning. My initial thought was increased efficiency, higher yields."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But efficiency for whom? When local politicians benefit personally, and 66% of deals are in food-insecure nations, the 'net positive' argument starts to fray."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] Indeed. The 'Scramble For The Solar System' piece comes to mind. Humanity seems hardwired for resource grabs, even if the methods evolve."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But we have the historical data now. We know the risks. We saw it in Ireland. We're seeing the precursors in the Congo, in Ethiopia, Sudan."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And the transformation of small holdings into large plantations for export... Where do these dispossessed people go?"
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] No, they won't. And if the 'renewables and battery revolution' shifts global demand, some of these agricultural exports might become less profitable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Leaving these countries with ecological damage, a dispossessed population, and massive social unrest. It's a truly volatile mix."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Okay, fine. I don't much care for the term 'neo-colonial', but the absentee ownership problem, coupled with weak governance and export focus... that's a dangerous brew."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's the recipe for disaster, James. And this time, with billions of people involved, the numbers are truly terrifying."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] That's actually devastating. You've convinced me that the Famine parallel isn't mere hyperbole. The scale of modern acquisitions means the potential human cost is unprecedented."
