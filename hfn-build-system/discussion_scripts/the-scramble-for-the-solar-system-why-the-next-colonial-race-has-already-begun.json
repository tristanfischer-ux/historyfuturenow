  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Oh, come on. That's a dramatic overstatement. The Outer Space Treaty specifically prohibits national appropriation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And the Treaty of Tordesillas prohibited anyone but Spain and Portugal. How well did that work out?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's different now. We have international agreements, a framework for cooperation. It's not the 15th century."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] The framework is already fragmenting. Artemis Accords versus China's unilateral plans. It's a legal vacuum, not a consensus."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But a scramble? You're framing this like a colonial land grab, which is... morally complicated, to say the least."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "History offers a consistent, unflinching answer: unclaimed territory in a competitive system gets claimed. Whether it's Africa or the Moon."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a cynical view. What about scientific exploration, the 'province of all mankind'?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article's clear: nations colonise for resources, strategic positions, and to pre-empt rivals. The romance is a convenient narrative."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, you're saying the Moon will be carved up like Africa at the Berlin Conference?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The Berlin Conference established 'effective occupation'. The US Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 is effectively the same principle for private entities."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really? Private companies can just... own parts of asteroids?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Own and sell resources extracted, yes. The US has made that explicit. And other nations are following suit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that completely undermines the spirit of the Outer Space Treaty!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The spirit doesn't launch rockets. SpaceX has reduced the cost per kilogram to orbit from $54,000 to under $2,000. That's the game changer."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's impressive, yes. But still, who's going to mine an asteroid? The costs are astronomical."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "At $200 a kilogram, the economics begin to close. At $50, they're compelling. Musk is targeting that with Starship."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Fifty dollars? That's... insane."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And 16 Psyche alone is worth $10,000 quadrillion in minerals. The potential returns are simply too vast to ignore."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] This feels like a dystopian sci-fi novel. Mega-corporations carving up the cosmos for profit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's the East India Company, isn't it? As the article points out, private companies with their own capital and objectives. SpaceX is the twenty-first century VOC."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "A private army next? I mean, where does that analogy break down?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] Not yet, no. But the Dutch East India Company had its own navy. They governed territories larger than many European nations. This is history rhyming, as we often say here at HFN."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, the historical parallels are certainly... unsettling. I can see the argument for the economic drivers. But the logistics of human colonisation remain immense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's the key difference this time. Robots go first. They survey, mine, build habitats. 'Robotics And Slavery' explored this on Earth, now apply it to space."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Robots... right. No life support, no food, no return ticket needed. That changes the cost-benefit analysis completely, doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Massively. A robot is a better colonist than a human. The nations with the most advanced AI and robotics will dominate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[thoughtful] So, it's less about populations or bravery, and more about technological sovereignty. This feeds into our discussions about 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power', doesn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. Beijing's lunar plans, their investment in AI. They're not signing the Artemis Accords for a reason. They're playing a different game."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Well... okay, that's harder to argue with than I expected. The combination of falling launch costs, asteroid wealth, and robotic pioneers... it does make this feel inevitable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] It's not a pretty picture. But the data points in one direction. Possession, as ever, will be nine-tenths of the law."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And the Outer Space Treaty? Just a piece of paper, like Tordesillas."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It won't be formally abrogated. It will simply become irrelevant, overtaken by facts on the Moon, and Mars. 'Effective occupation'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the question isn't whether space will be colonised, but by whom, and under whose rules. And the rules will be written by those who get there first."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The scramble has already begun. The great powers of the future will be those who control access to these new frontiers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's... actually devastating. For the rest of us, anyway."
