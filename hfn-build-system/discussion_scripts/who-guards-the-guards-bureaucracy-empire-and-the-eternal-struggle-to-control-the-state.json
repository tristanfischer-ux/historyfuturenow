    "text": "Musk's latest venture? Hard to see that as a serious answer to Juvenal. More like a rich man's hobby horse, surely."

    "text": "A hobby horse that identified $215 billion in potential cuts in a single year. Not nothing."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But the article makes it clear: the pushback was instant. Unions, judges, politicians. The bureaucracy defended itself."

    "text": "[dry] As it always does. Rome tried to run an empire on a lean republic. It couldn't last."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "They needed administration for a vast empire. That's not the same as bureaucratic bloat."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Perhaps. But Lactantius complained more people lived off the state than paid into it. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?"

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "I think you're cherry-picking. That's a huge leap from ancient Rome to a modern welfare state."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Is it? The Janissaries. Created for merit, became a parasitic, hereditary caste. They blocked reform, murdered sultans."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Through violence, yes. That's exactly why it's not a model for modern governance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[clipped] No, but it shows how deeply entrenched these systems become. Unreformable from within."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But we're talking about providing healthcare and education, not an elite military corps. Our bureaucracies serve a purpose."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And Parkinson's Law still applies. The British Colonial Office grew as the empire shrank. The Admiralty did the same."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a convenient reading of the data. Are you suggesting we don't need *any* regulation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] The UK's tax code is now longer than the complete works of Shakespeare. Several times over. That's not efficiency."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, that's... actually devastating."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And the EU. 60,000 officials, not counting the national staff implementing their directives. The system feeds itself."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So what's the solution then? Just... fire everyone? That's not realistic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "This is where AI changes the equation. Musk's DOGE was an attempt, but AI is the real disruptive force."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[frustrated] Oh, come on. AI replacing bureaucrats? That's just a recipe for mass unemployment and algorithmic bias."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not necessarily. Estonia runs a digitally native government with a fraction of the staff. Taxes in minutes, voting online, businesses in hours."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "[surprised] Wait, really? That efficient?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes. And they don't need thousands of 'AI oversight officers' to oversee AI systems designed to replace officials. That's the EU's proposed path, isn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's another layer, another bureaucracy. I remember you called the EU's approach to regulation 'bloated' in our 'Europe Rearms' discussion."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Precisely. The bureaucracy absorbing the solution, turning it into more bureaucracy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Well... okay, that's harder to argue with than I expected. If the services are genuinely maintained, even improved, and the cost plummets without actual human suffering, then the economic argument is quite strong. I don't want to agree with you on this, but the numbers from Estonia don't leave much room for counterargument."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] Fair enough. No one wants human suffering. But ignoring the potential is suffering of another kind."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, the choice is clear: lean, AI-enabled states or bloated, stagnant ones? That's quite a stark future."
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "History suggests a divergence. The Chinese examination system failed to adapt, remember? That led to the 'century of humiliation'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Right. So, the question becomes: will AI be captured and become another layer? Or will it finally guard the guards?"
  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "And can democratic societies achieve what Mahmud II did in 1826—dismantling a parasitic class—without the violence?"
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's the real challenge. Without resorting to cannons, I mean."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. Or do we just drift, like the late Roman Empire, into sclerosis? It touches on 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West'."
