  },

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "China isn't inviting millions to its shores for citizenship. It's exploiting resources. That's a very different kind of migration."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The 'gates slamming shut' examples – Britain 1962, Germany 1973 – show a *reaction* to perceived pressure, not a failure of integration itself."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] Not a direct line, no. But the pressure points, the consequences of large, rapid demographic shifts, they rhyme. Remember 'Crisis: Or An Explanation...'? Rome's internal weaknesses made it vulnerable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Rome had internal decay, yes. But it also *recruited* Germanic tribes into its army and settled them. That's a different dynamic than being 'crushed'."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Precisely. Or the Greeks under Roman rule. Europe's institutions, its languages, its core culture are far too robust to be 'wiped out' overnight."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That assumes the immigrants are a 'small, technically superior group' as the article states. The current projections are for a *very large* group."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Not necessarily militarily superior, no. But in terms of economic contribution, a younger, more dynamic workforce could be seen as an advantage for aging Europe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] The problem isn't dynamic. It's too many people for too few resources in their home countries."

    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] Perhaps 'wiped out' is hyperbolic for modern Europe. But 'radically changed' seems inevitable. The article's historical sweep suggests that."

    "speaker": "Elena",

    "text": "[amused] Optimistic. History suggests adaptation is often brutal, not always managed by committees."
  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But history *also* shows cultures absorbing new influences, sometimes enriching them. We have international agencies and agreements now. That's the difference."
