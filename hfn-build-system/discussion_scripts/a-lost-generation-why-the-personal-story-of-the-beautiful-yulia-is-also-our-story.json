    "speaker": "James",

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's a systemic problem, not a sign of imminent collapse. We need different housing policies, clearly."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Hold on— that's extreme. We're not seeing that here. People are just having kids later, or perhaps fewer."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Okay, the demographic shift is real. I'll give you that. But it's not Yulia's story."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Not yet. But the article's point is that a generation faces truncated dreams. The 'Downton Abbey' scenario, where the rich have 'home help'—"

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Oh, come on. We're not going back to upstairs-downstairs. Automation is taking those jobs anyway. See our piece on renewables and battery tech."

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's unfair. They're trying to stimulate the economy, invest in green tech—"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "James",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No. That's completely wrong, and I'll tell you why. That's not a solution, that's outright disenfranchisement. Anti-democratic."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "I agree it's abhorrent. But the article points out the US already uses similar tactics. Lock up minorities for petty crimes, they lose the vote."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's not a model to emulate, James. That's a moral failing, a perversion of democracy, not a fix for economic woes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",

  },

    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But it won't fix the underlying economic crisis. It just silences the people most affected. That's not a solution, it's a cover-up."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. The article concludes by recalling the Soviet collapse. Unexpected, yet in hindsight, predictable. We have so many structural problems today, it requires little imagination to forecast similar decline. 'The Rise of the West Was Based on Luck' comes to mind."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
