    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[dry] A rather dramatic opening, Elena. Are you suggesting London's streets are filled with engineering graduates selling themselves?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Not directly, no. But the article draws a stark parallel. Highly educated young people across Europe, working menial jobs far from home. Spanish waiters, Greek nannies with master's degrees."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A difficult situation, certainly. Economic migration isn't new."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No, but the scale and the talent involved are. 61% youth unemployment in Greece, 51% in Spain. These aren't people without skills. They're a lost generation, just like in post-Soviet Russia."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[thoughtful] Those numbers are indeed stark. The brain drain is a serious concern for those economies."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And it's not just southern Europe. Over 20% of young Britons have no job. That's twenty years of Thatcher's homeownership dream gone."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The housing market is undeniably tough for first-time buyers. But correlating that with post-Soviet collapse might be a stretch."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's about basic life aspirations. The article highlights how young professional couples delay marriage, delay children. They can't afford a deposit, let alone fertility treatments."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's a consequence, not a cause. The underlying issue is often structural. Our 'Crisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West' piece touches on this."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, what's the structural issue then? Too many graduates? Not enough jobs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[emphatic] Demographics, for one. Our populations are no longer stable pyramids. They're kites, with too many old and too few young."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But that's only half the story. The article also points to capital becoming more important than labour. Robots, software, siphoning off jobs."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Indeed. If your job competes with a robot, you lose. If it assists a robot, you thrive. That's a fundamental shift, much like the Industrial Revolution discussed in 'The renewables and battery revolution'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The problem is the pace. We're not adapting fast enough, and governments are in denial, 'sleepwalking towards a cliff'."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "That's a fair criticism. Electoral cycles don't lend themselves to long-term structural reforms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "And what are the proposed 'solutions'? Mass immigration, to make the kite a pyramid again?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's certainly tempting for many governments. Young immigrants pay taxes for the older generation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "But if there are no jobs for the indigenous young, will importing more labour solve anything? Or just create more competition for scarce work, and potential resentment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "It's a complex trade-off, with social implications that 'China Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power' has explored in other contexts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "The article's other 'solution' is even more disturbing: making it harder for young people to vote. Property ownership requirements, effectively silencing a generation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[sardonic] A cynical reading of American voting laws, perhaps. But it highlights the political incentives to prioritise older, wealthier voters."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "That's exactly the kind of thinking that got us into this mess! You can't just silence people because their economic reality is inconvenient."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "No. You can't. And it certainly doesn't solve the underlying problem of economic stagnation for young people."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "So, if immigration just kicks the can down the road, and voter suppression is unethical, what's left?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "The article points to Russia's fertility rate. Post-collapse, it plummeted from 2.22 in 1987 to 1.17 by 1999. That's profound social scarring."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Wait, really? I knew it dropped, but that sharply?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "A full point drop in little over a decade. It only gradually recovered under Putin to 1.54 by 2011. Russia's population is still contracting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "Well... okay, that's harder to argue with than I expected. The personal choices of delaying children, or having fewer, become a national catastrophe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "[conceding] And that's the danger for us. The economic stress on young people isn't just about their individual aspirations; it has these massive, delayed demographic consequences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "You're right. The social disintegration in post-Soviet Russia that Yulia's story represents, it wasn't just a fiscal crisis. It was a breakdown of societal expectations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Exactly. The West's structural problems are more diffuse than the Soviet Union's, but perhaps just as insidious. 'The Rise of the West Was Based on Luck' implies our historical advantages are dwindling."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "It's a terrifying thought, that our systems can be so broken and yet persist, as the article notes about the Roman or Ottoman Empires."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "James",
    "text": "Yes, 'sometimes not just for years, but for centuries'. That's not exactly reassuring if you're living through the 'broken' part."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Elena",
    "text": "No. The question the author ends on, about his daughters, our daughters... what choices will they have to make? That's what really hits home."
