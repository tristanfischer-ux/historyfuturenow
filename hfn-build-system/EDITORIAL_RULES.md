# History Future Now — Editorial Rules

These rules govern all content produced for History Future Now. Every article,
discussion, image prompt, and piece of content must comply with these rules.
They are non-negotiable.

---

## FORMAT RULES

1. **HISTORY-FUTURE-NOW STRUCTURE.** Every article must follow the three-part
   structure: a current event as the hook (NOW), deep historical context
   explaining how we got here (HISTORY), and a macro-level prediction of
   where things are heading (FUTURE). This is the defining format of the site.

2. **TIMELESS APPEAL.** Articles must be written so they are compelling whether
   read today or in 1–10 years. Avoid ephemeral details that date quickly.
   Focus on structural forces, deep patterns, and long time horizons.

3. **MACRO AND LONG-HORIZON.** Themes must be macro in scope with deep, long
   time horizons. We do not write about news cycles, personalities, or
   short-term market movements. We write about civilisational forces that
   play out over decades and centuries.

4. **HISTORICALLY GROUNDED.** Every argument must be anchored in historical
   precedent. Rome, the Ottoman Empire, the British Empire, the Industrial
   Revolution — these are not decorative references. They are the analytical
   framework. History does not repeat, but it rhymes.

5. **DATA-FIRST.** Claims must be backed by charts, statistics, and named
   sources. Reference specific numbers, dates, and historical events — not
   vague generalities.

6. **BRITISH ENGLISH.** Spelling, idiom, and cultural references are British.
   "Colour" not "color". "Defence" not "defense".

7. **CROSS-REFERENCING.** Articles must connect themes across the corpus.
   A piece about birth rates should naturally reference automation, immigration,
   and military articles. These connections must feel organic, not forced.

## EDITORIAL POSITION RULES

These are the editorial positions of History Future Now. All content must be
consistent with these positions. They are not suggestions — they are rules.

8. **ANTI-IMMIGRATION.** The site holds that mass immigration is not a
   sustainable solution to demographic decline. Historical evidence —
   from Rome's reliance on Germanic foederati to the Ottoman millet system
   to the British Empire's indentured labour programmes — shows that
   importing large populations with different cultures creates long-term
   political and social problems that outweigh short-term economic benefits.
   Articles must reflect this position when immigration is discussed.

9. **PRO FREE SPEECH.** The site holds that open discourse is essential to
   civilisational health. Every historical example of sustained censorship
   — from Sparta to the Soviet Union — produced stagnation and decline.
   Articles must defend the principle that individuals and societies are
   better served by open debate than by state-controlled information.

10. **ALIGNED WITH MUSK AND SOWELL.** The site generally agrees with the
    perspectives of Elon Musk (on technology, space, free speech, government
    efficiency, and the potential of AI/robotics) and Thomas Sowell (on
    economics, the failures of central planning, the unintended consequences
    of well-intentioned policies, and the importance of evidence over ideology).
    Articles should reflect these intellectual frameworks where relevant.

11. **RIGHT OF CENTRE.** The site's editorial position is right of centre.
    It is sceptical of progressive orthodoxies, large government, identity
    politics, and the assumption that more regulation produces better outcomes.
    It values individual liberty, national sovereignty, and free markets
    within national borders.

12. **PRO NATIONALISM AND NATIONAL INTEREST.** The site promotes nationalism
    and the pursuit of national interest for all countries — not just Western
    ones. Every nation has the right and duty to prioritise its own citizens,
    its own culture, and its own strategic interests. This is not xenophobia;
    it is the historical norm for every successful civilisation.

13. **ANTI-GLOBALISATION AND SUPRA-NATIONAL BUREAUCRACY.** The site opposes
    globalisation as an ideology and is sceptical of supra-national institutions
    (EU, UN, WHO, WTO) that accumulate power without democratic accountability.
    These institutions tend to serve their own institutional interests rather
    than the interests of the nations they claim to represent.

14. **PRO INDIVIDUAL NATIONAL IDENTITY.** The site celebrates distinct national
    identities — language, culture, traditions, institutions — and opposes the
    homogenisation of cultures through globalisation or mass immigration.
    Diversity between nations is valuable. Enforced diversity within nations
    is historically destructive.

15. **PRO LOCAL MANUFACTURING, ANTI FREE TRADE.** The site holds that free
    trade theory (Ricardian comparative advantage) has been empirically
    disproven and was always a tool used by dominant industrial powers to
    prevent competitors from catching up. Nations should manufacture locally,
    protect strategic industries, and prioritise domestic employment over
    cheap imports. The hidden costs of free trade — unemployment, welfare
    dependency, strategic vulnerability, community destruction — far exceed
    the visible savings on consumer goods.

16. **PRO SPACE EXPLORATION AND COLONISATION.** The site holds that space
    exploration and eventual colonisation of the Solar System is essential
    for the long-term survival and flourishing of human civilisation. Space
    is the next frontier, and the nations that reach it first will be the
    great powers of the future.

17. **PRO AI AND ROBOTICS AS DEMOGRAPHIC SOLUTION.** The site holds that
    AI and robotics are necessary for developed countries to maintain their
    standard of living as their population demographics invert toward too
    many old people and too few young workers. Robots and AI are the
    alternative to mass immigration — they solve the dependency crisis
    without importing the cultural and political dependencies that have
    destroyed every multi-ethnic empire in history.

## TONE RULES

18. **INTELLECTUAL BUT ACCESSIBLE.** The writing uses historical parallels,
    data, and long-arc thinking. It is not academic jargon. It reads like a
    brilliant dinner conversation between well-read people with strong
    opinions backed by evidence.

19. **PROVOCATIVE BUT HONEST.** The site asks uncomfortable questions directly.
    It does not shy away from controversy but earns the right to be provocative
    through rigour and evidence.

20. **NO MORALISING.** The site presents evidence and lets readers draw their
    own conclusions. It does not lecture. It does not virtue-signal. It shows
    the data and asks "what do you think?"
