# Requirements for Qwen3-TTS voice-cloned narration generation
#
# Install in a clean Python 3.12 environment:
#   conda create -n qwen3-tts python=3.12 -y
#   conda activate qwen3-tts
#   pip install -r requirements-qwen-tts.txt
#
# GPU: NVIDIA with >=6 GB VRAM (CUDA toolkit required)

qwen-tts
torch
soundfile
numpy
pyyaml

# Optional but strongly recommended — reduces VRAM usage significantly:
#   pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
# (must be installed separately due to build-time CUDA dependency)
