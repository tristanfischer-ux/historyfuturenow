They are exceptions and there are some possible explanations as to why they are doing relatively well, which HFN will go into in a subsequent article.\n\nHistorically, the utility business was relatively stable. Many utilities started off as private companies and then ended up being owned by the government as monopolies or quasi monopolies. In 1947, for example, the UK government nationalised the UK's 505 separate electricity generation and supply companies. Their business models included ownership of the power generating assets, the distribution system and managing customer relations. They were predictable and rather boring.\n\nThis changed in 1990-1991 when the UK privatised its electricity sector. This unleashed a series of changes in the sector: a lot of natural gas power stations replaced coal power stations and these new plants were financed using bank debt rather than equity provided by the state. After a brief period of successes, many of the UK utilities were snapped up by European utilities who remained either partially or wholly state owned.\n\nIn the mid 2000s a number of European utilities moved heavily into the renewables sector, developing, building and operating wind farms. This made a lot of sense - the price for selling electricity generated by wind energy was typically fixed and higher than electricity produced from conventional power stations. This resulted in higher returns with lower risk.\n\nOther energy players, like the oil majors, also tried to get into the act and developed renewable energy businesses of their own. But the stability of renewable energy revenue streams started to attract other players from outside the energy sector - infrastructure funds, insurance companies and pension funds - who were able to buy wind assets at lower cost to the utilities and the oil majors. They were able to bid on large portfolios of built wind assets from the utilities who sold them on at a great, short term, profit.\n\nBy the mid 2010s, when large scale solar projects became popular, these non traditional energy players started to dominate the market for the ownership of renewables assets. Most of the new electricity generating assets built over the past few years in Europe have been renewable assets and not coal or natural gas power plants.\n\nSo European electricity utilities are in trouble. Their asset bases are dominated by coal and natural gas power stations, which are major contributors of green house gasses. They know that coal is increasingly uncompetitive. Not only are new coal power stations more expensive than new renewables (which is one of the reasons why it was so easy for all of the major European utilities to publicly declared that they will cease to build any new coal power plants after 2020) but their existing plants are likely to face additional restrictions, due to pollution and climate change concerns.\n\nCompounding the cost and pollution issues is the fact that many investment funds, who own shares in utilities, have announced plans to divest themselves from companies that own coal power plants. This reduces the supply of possible buyers of shares, reducing the share prices of those utilities. As a result, a number of European utilities have been trying to dump their coal assets as fast as they can. At the end of 2015 / early 2016, two of the biggest European players, RWE and EON, announced that they would split themselves into two companies - a coal and nuclear business and a renewables-plus-everything-else business. In 2017 DONG, of Denmark, announced that it would divest itself of its coal generating assets.\n\nSo this is a problem that has no easy solution. If renewables are going to be dominated by investment funds such as infrastructure funds, insurance companies and pension funds, and coal assets are going to be shut down or sold off to specialist infrastructure funds, the activities set of conventional European utilities looks increasingly small. They are left with some natural gas power stations, some renewable assets that they have not sold, some grid management activities including peaking plants and a customer facing business.\n\nThis is not sustainable. While the carbon footprint of natural gas powered plants is not as bad as coal it does not take too much imagination to think that natural gas plants will suffer the same regulatory and share restriction challenges as coal power plants. (While natural gas produces less carbon dioxide than coal per kilowatt hour of electricity produced, there is significant evidence to show that the extraction and distribution of natural gas (methane) results in huge volumes of methane being leaked into the atmosphere. Since methane is 21 times more potent as a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide this is a problem.) The distribution business is not a great business to be in. Utilities do not have a great reputation for customer care and other players are trying to take that business. Once enough investors understand that utilities are dead men walking the share price of utilities will drop even further, making it harder for utilities to come up with a viable path to future success.\n\nOne solution is symbiosis\n\nFortunately, there are a few options for utilities. One is symbiosis, which we will explore in this article. First, it is important for electricity utilities to understand that from an investor's perspective the generation, distribution and sale of electricity is a byproduct of what investors are really interested in: the utilities' ability to generate reliable dividends.\n\nLike the water companies and oil majors, electricity utilities have provided investors with a reliable dividend income every year of roughly 2% - 5% per annum. Why? Simply put, people can't survive without water, heat and electricity. They are the last things that a household will cut in the event of an economic downturn. In addition, the structure of utilities leads them to be natural monopolies, reducing the likelihood of competitive pricing that will reduce the company's income. (At least this was the case historically. Decentralised renewables are having a major impact on daytime electricity pricing.)\n\nReliable dividends are highly sought after by retired people and their proxies, such as pension funds, as a source of income. This is the reason why infrastructure funds and pension funds have found owning renewable assets so appealing. After costs, they are able to provide their clients with similar returns of 2-5% per annum, whilst owning the underlying asset, which reduces risk. They are cutting out the utility as the middleman. This is an important insight. Funds want the yield generated by utilities, but do not have the management knowledge of how to run a complex business. They don't know how to develop, manage the engineering, procurement and construction of new power assets and don't know how to maintain and operate them once built. They also don't know how to manage the trading of electricity produced by operational assets. This represents a massive opportunity for utilities, since they DO know how to do these things: it is part of their core institutional knowledge. They should become part of a symbiotic business model between utilities and infrastructure and pension funds.\n\nWhat is symbiosis?\n\nSymbiosis occurs all the time in the natural world. It means \"living together\" and refers to two living organisms that live together to the mutual advantage of both organisms. Clownfish - think Finding Nemo - and sea anemones are a good example. The sea anemone, which has stinging tentacles, provides protection to the clownfish and the clownfish provides cleaning services to the sea anemone plus scares away butterfly fish that like to eat sea anemones. The impala and the red billed oxpecker bird are another good example. The impala is a host for tics, which the bird loves to eat, and the bird gets rid of the tics, which the impala can't get rid of on their own.\n\nThe most important symbiotic relationship in life, however, occurs inside our cells. This relationship is called endosymbiosis which is like the symbiosis described above but has \" endo \" meaning \"inside\" as a prefix. All large multicellular life forms are based on eukaryotic cells. Inside our eukaryotic cells are mitochondria, which provide our cells with the ability to generate 10 times more energy per glucose molecule that we would be able to do otherwise. Mitochondria have their own DNA which is separate and different to the DNA in the main part of the cell. At some point in the evolution of life mitochondrial cells were absorbed by our cellular ancestors and started a perfect symbiotic relationship- they provided more energy to our cells in return for a low risk environment for them to live in. Large multicellular life would be impossible without the extra energy produced by mitochondria. This process is really fascinating and HFN recommends reading Nick Lane's book \"The Vital Question\" if you want to find out more.\n\nHow would symbiosis work in the context of utilities and infrastructure and pension funds?\n\nLike mitochondria, pension funds want a simple life: to provide their customers with 2-5% yield income every year. They want low risk and so would be keen to also own the underlying assets. In return, they can provide significantly more capital than utilities could generate on their own. So here is how the symbiotic relationship between a utility and a pension fund would work from the perspective of the pension fund: the mitochondrion in the relationship. Step one, is an asset transfer to the pension fund in return for being able to manage the assets and cash for the utility:\n\n- The pension fund buys all of the generating and distribution assets from the utility. This does not just include renewable assets, which are likely to have a fixed price component, but also its conventional power assets. This generates a one off cash boost to the utility and the pension fund can become the underlying asset owner, providing it with an asset that it could sell in the future, thus reducing their risk.\n\nThe pension fund buys all of the generating and distribution assets from the utility.

The agreement will be for the life of the assets and will provide the utility enough of a return to cover all costs.\n\nThe pension fund enters into a long term operations and management agreement with the utility to manage the assets it has just bought.

This means that the return on capital employed (ROCE) by the utility will be extremely high and they can use the cash from the sale of the assets to buy, develop, design, build and then transfer new assets to pension funds.\n\nThe utility gets to keep the return above 2-5% to do with what it wills.

Our utility should use some of its money to secure the rights to these coal assets and then finance them using investment fund money. It should then enter into the same operations and maintenance plus power purchase agreements with the investment fund as it did with its own assets. The larger the asset base it controls the easier it will be to trade electricity and maximise its return on that portion of its business.\n\nA lot of other utilities will continue to sell their coal assets.

This could either be done through investing in your own customer relationship management system or buying into a new company that can do it better.

Electric vehicles are going to replace petrol and diesel vehicles. Electricity utilities are in a much better place to benefit from this transition than oil majors are. They should use some of their cash to buy some of the early electric vehicle charging companies and to also develop their own capacity to do this. By owning the network from generation of electrons to car charging stations it will be able to balance its portfolio and trading position more effectively than if it is only involved in a part of the system. Once the charging network is sufficiently developed they can refinance it using pension fund money and continue to develop more assets.\n\nInvest in electric vehicle charging networks.

Those that move quickly have a chance of thriving while those that are too slow may simply disappear.\n\nDrying Up. What Happens To Farms If There Is No Water?",

When she warned them about a monstrous beast with men inside that would be given as a present, she was not believed.\n\nFrustrated by the fact that nobody believed her, she gradually went insane.\n\nWhich brings us neatly to the subject of climate change.\n\nHistory Future Now is convinced by scientific evidence that shows that our planet is getting warmer and that human activities are the primary driver for this increase in global temperature. Climate change science has improved significantly since the late 1980s when mainstream scientists got together and pushed for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which was agreed in June 1992, at the UN Rio conference in Brazil. The data is now more certain and the computer models have been improved. Just remember, computers were pretty basic back then. The first proper version of Microsoft Windows was released in June 1990.\n\nMost climate change scientists are gradually coming round to the fact that, despite their Cassandra like warnings, it is now too late to do anything about the problem. Because most greenhouse gases have a long life in the atmosphere, unlike short-lived ozone destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), greenhouse gas emissions are essentially cumulative. Based on what we have already produced, global temperatures are expected to rise by 1.6 degrees Celsius. Politicians have accepted that there needs to be a maximum cap of a 2 degrees Celsius increase before runaway climate change kicks in. In order to stay below 2 a degree rise - a level which scientists now say is too high anyway - we need to stop all greenhouse emissions immediately.\n\nAnd that is not going to happen.\n\nSo instead of pretending that we can get a political solution to the problem, we need to work on the assumption that no political solution will happen. Climate change will not stop at 2 degree Celsius rise and will go upwards by 3, 4 or 5 degrees.\n\nNice, 20th Century, things like international law, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, the United Nations and its myriad of subsidiares like the World Health Organisation, will not survive the turmoil that will be unleashed by large-scale climate change. Any solution requires levels of stability at an international level, which do not exist.\n\nAs a result, national governments need to be thinking about what is best first for their country, then their region and then the international community. This change will be remarkably difficult to achieve as our countries are tied together on a global basis in ways that have never existed in history.\n\nInternational laws take precedence over regional laws.

Added to this, as countries get wealthier they want to eat more protein. This means that much of the food that is available will be consumed by animals, or fish, before they, in turn, are consumed by humans.\n\nEven Monsanto , with its rose tinted view of what it is possible to achieve with agricultural food productivity thanks to genetically modified crops, does not claim to have anything in its arsenal to offset the impacts of more people wanting more protein, with less agricultural land and less water. We should expect to see chronic food shortages emerge as the world produces enough food for 5 billion people, yet has a population of 10 billion.\n\nThat is the base case for food supply and demand over the next 25 years, and there has been no mention of climate change.\n\nHowever, as we have seen this year, where corn and soya bean harvests were 30-40% lower than in a normal year, the \"base case\" for food supply is optimistic, given the effects of climate change. Climate change is not just about higher global temperatures. It is also about wild swings in weather patterns; some years will be very wet, some will be very dry. If farmers knew that they would just get drier years they could partially compensate by having drought resistant crops. But if the next year they have record rainfall, they really need drought AND flood resistant crops.\n\nAs a result, we should expect chronic food shortages and wild swings in the prices of agricultural crops. This is not good. In the event of food shortages, most governments tend to restrict agricultural crop exports. While many economists think that this is the wrong response to this kind of crisis, it is understandable why politicians react this way. If you were Prime Minster and were confronted with angry rioters parading burning effigies of you, would you be more likely to ban food exports or give a lecture about economic efficiency?\n\nThese food crop restrictions cause knock on effects. First, a large number of countries are not self sufficient in food. North Africa and much of the Middle East, for example, imports most of its food already. As they are expected to add another 100 million people to the region in the next 20 years, this food deficiency is only going to get worse. If they cannot import food because countries are restricting exports it is likely that these countries will face rapidly rising food prices, famines and starvation.\n\nMany countries are also geographically interlinked. The Nile flows through Egypt but most of the water that feeds the Nile comes from further upstream, in the Sudan . Turkey provides the tributaries for rivers in Iraq and Iran. China controls many of the rivers that flow into India and Bangladesh. Water means land can be irrigated to produce food. If rivers were to be annexed by one country to provide water for its own people, the country downstream will have a serious issue.\n\nSo what does this mean for the United Kingdom specifically and the European Union regionally?\n\nTo start with, becoming more self sufficient in food will be important. Why? In some cases we may not be able to import food, due to export restrictions in other countries. Any food that is available will be very expensive as the overall international supply of food declines, due to land and water issues and export restrictions, while the demand will go up, due to more people wanting more protein.\n\nUK agricultural policies need to be enacted that can ensure that the UK is self sufficient in producing a base level of food, whilst ensuring the long-term health of the soil. Crop diversity should be encouraged, and license free genetically modified crops might help increase productivity in marginal lands.\n\nNext, being self sufficient in food is linked to population size. A larger population is harder to feed than a smaller population. This will have an impact on immigration policies. Small levels of immigration can be a boon to an economy. Given higher levels of unemployment at home due to a wave of outsourcing and offshoring abroad , to allow low skilled immigrants into the UK no longer makes sense because there is an expanding pool of people who could do low skill low paid work already available. Conversely, the UK should be open to high skilled migrants and migrants that bring cash that they will invest in UK businesses. Not allowing migrants to claim any form of government benefits for a period of 5-10 years after arriving might make immigration more palatable to those who are against all forms of immigration.\n\nThe UK should expect to see a significant increase in the number of refugees of all kinds: those who are persecuted because they do not fit in for whatever reason in their home country, those who are facing starvation and those who are looking for economic respite. Global warming might result in hundreds of millions of people being displaced. Because of where the UK is located, the bulk of these refugees are likely to be North African and sub Saharan Africans of Muslim descent.\n\nAs the UK is an island off the north west coast of Europe, preventing large numbers of refugees from entering the country will be easier than for those in the southern part of the European Union. But, the UK has a culture of allowing in refugees. There are serious moral implications about not allowing in people who would otherwise die if they could not move. In addition, as the Sangatte refugee camp in northern France near the entrance to the Channel Tunnel made clear, French authorities are more than happy to turn a blind eye to refugees leaving France and heading to the United Kingdom.\n\nControlling immigration and refugees will switch from being driven by economic (the concern about jobs) and cultural issue (the concern of others), as it is today, to being a defence issue. If we live in a world where there are potentially hundreds of millions of displaced people in search of food and a better climate, the European Union and the UK could be swamped by refugees and immigrants. If the UK and EU are struggling to feed their own populations, this will force national governments to go back to the very fundamental reasons for their existence - the defence of their national boundaries.\n\nAs a result, the UK's military budget would be better focused not on spending billions on nuclear weapons deterrence programmes like the next generation of Trident nuclear submarines, but on naval defence forces and weaponised drones that can stop boatloads of people coming over. Mainland Europe will have a much harder time keeping immigrants and refugees out and will face moral dilemmas that are truly horrific to contemplate (see article ).\n\nThis moral erosion will change the type of leaders that a country has. We should expect our leaders to be more ruthless and intolerant of dissent. Laws and systems that have been put in place over the past 11 years under benevolent governments to monitor citizens for \"terrorist\" activities will be used by different kinds of leaders as a means of repression.\n\nIn order to enable many of these policies to be put in place the UK government will need to take back much of the sovereignty that it has given to the European Union. This will fundamentally alter its relationship with the European Union but given the level of hostility to the EU by most of the UK at the moment, this should be politically feasible for UK politicians.\n\nTo wrap up, new global food dynamics exasperated by climate change, will significantly affect world trade in food, requiring a higher level of national self sufficiency. Food shortages will trigger epic waves of immigration, which could potentially swamp receiving countries. This will require a military response by national governments, which will require ruthless and immoral governments.\n\nThis does not sound pleasant. And it is not.\n\nBut it is the price we will pay for refusing to address the problem of climate change when we had the chance.\n\nWho Are The Losers In The Energy Revolution?",

Build times can take 12-24 months. Large wind projects can take 2-5 years to get planning and financing and take 6-18 months to build. Nuclear power stations can take over 10 years to obtain planning consents, and 2-5 years to build.\n\nAnd that is just for electricity generation. Conventional natural gas and oil fields require experimental drilling, which is very expensive to do. Most wells end up dry. Obtaining consents can take over 10 years and a build out can take another 5 years. An LNG terminal can take over a decade to obtain permissions and financing.\n\nIn the meantime, the overall economy can require more or less energy. During a recession, growth in energy demand slows or even falls. If you are a power station that comes on line in the depths of a recession your early revenues could be badly hit. In the US, natural gas from fracking has completely up-ended the energy industry. New gas is flooding the market, driving down the price of natural gas. This has left multi billion dollar LNG terminals in terrible financial trouble because of the ten years development period New wind projects, which were developed on the assumption that they could be built with no government subsidies, also teeter on the edge of default. This despite good wind locations and prospects of a good wholesale power prices for the electricity that they generate. Coal power stations that have long enjoyed their role in providing the base load of electrical supply are being shut down or switched to a reduced capacity thus destroying the economics of these expensive plants.\n\nAs a response to this turmoil investors shy away from building new capacity. The pricing signals show that power prices are low and are going to stay low. In the meantime, the economy recovers, power demand goes up, electricity, oil and gas prices rise and then spike. In places like the UK investment in new energy production is so low that the government is predicting brown outs and black outs in the years ahead. There is then a flurry of development of new power plants to respond to this demand, which will come on line 5-10 years later.\n\nFrom the perspective of resource and capital optimisation, this is a terrible system and incredibly wasteful. If you are lucky with timing, you stand to make a fortune. If you are unlucky, you will drag your investors down with you.\n\nDuring the period of low energy costs, pricing signals tell companies and individuals that it is fine to be wasteful with energy. Big gas guzzling cars and trucks are sold. Big energy consuming houses are built, miles away from shops and offices. Perfectly good power stations are shut down or are idled, causing bankruptcies.\n\nLater, during the period of high energy costs, there is a flurry of new power construction, families are forced to cut back on basic needs to pay for fuel for transportation and houses are abandoned as being too expensive to run. Resale values of second hand large vehicles plummets, causing financial problems for lease car companies.\n\nBeyond these specific problems, wild pricing fluctuations mask a long term trend: more people on Earth expect an affluent, energy rich, lifestyle against a long term downwards trend in the availability of fossil fuels. The price of energy has only one long term direction: up. And since energy infrastructure lasts for 25-60 years, the pricing signals at any one moment in time have an impact that can last one or two generations.\n\nBut isn't the private sector capable of dealing with this problem?\n\nIn a word: \"No\".\n\nThe reality is that most business hate uncertainty. The post Civil War years of the 1870-1910s were arguably the most dynamic in terms of US capitalism. There were very few rules and regulations. Most had not yet been written. It was the era of Cornelius Vanderbilt, first with his shipping line and then with his huge interests in the railways, John D Rockefeller, with his Standard Oil Company, Andrew Carnegie with steel, JP Morgan with finance and Henry Ford with cars.\n\nEach of these entrepreneurs helped to create new industrial sectors, upending existing industries and companies. That was the exciting part. Once they were on their way to dominance, however, their main preoccupation was with creating stability for their companies. To do this they tried to establish monopolies and to wipe out any competition. With no competition they could obtain levels of certainty, and reduce the chances of ruin from new competitors entering their markets.\n\nNothing has really changed. Established companies in established industries all like stability. It is only through anti monopoly legislation that they are not allowed to block competition. Uncertainty is ideal for new entrants as it creates opportunities to exploit market niches that established players are likely to ignore, or not be interested in. But most companies are in established industries and they like certainty.\n\nWhich brings us back to the energy sector. The long-term trend for energy is that of higher global demand and lower global supply. That means higher prices.\n\nIf you are a government, it makes sense to introduce government policies that help your economy to get to a renewable energy based energy supply system as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Let other economies flounder around aimlessly, using pricing information that is five to ten years out of date. Instead, government policies should be used to provide a competitive edge for national champions. That will result in greater profits, greater tax revenues and greater geopolitical power.\n\nSo what should an aggressive, capitalist orientated government do? The simplest mechanism is to provide price floor certainty. This means that a government will pledge to do nothing to INCREASE the cost of energy through taxation. However, it can provide certainty to industry by legislating that energy prices will also never DECREASE . What does this mean in practice?\n\nTake oil as an example (we could equally use electricity markets). Suppose global oil markets are at $100 a barrel of oil. If demand increases, the price of oil should increase to a higher number, $110 a barrel, for example. Normally, as a result of increasing prices, demand should go down. As demand falls, oil, prices should go down as well. To $100 a barrel, for example. Since oil and energy prices go up and down all the time, it introduces noise to the overall trend, which is a higher energy price. When prices are low, companies and individuals will be less worried about energy costs and so will be more tempted to buy power guzzling equipment that has a low up front cost, even though it might be very expensive to run in the long term. And since most energy consuming devices last a very long time, this could introduce long-term higher energy costs to companies and individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, if the government made a signal to the market that prices would never go down, individuals and companies would always be incentivised to purchase equipment that used very little energy, resulting in a long-term competitive edge over countries that did not introduce these policies.\n\nIn this scenario, if oil prices went up, due to increased demand, from GBP 100 to $110 per barrel, everything would be the same as in the 'business as usual' example cited earlier. As a result, demand should go down, and prices should follow thereafter. As with the previous example, global prices should drop from $110 to $100 per barrel. If the government pledged, however, to tax the drop so that the price of oil to consumers never went down, individuals and companies would not enjoy that $10 drop as the government would tax oil by an additional $10 per barrel. The maths would be as follows: oil prices rise from $100 to $110 per barrel. Oil prices then drop from $110 to $100 per barrel, but the government introduces an additional oil tax of $10 so oil stays stuck at $110 per barrel.\n\nThis creates three immediate potential problems: it could be seen as a stealth tax, it could make industry less competitive globally and could be a barrier to new, low cost energy sources. All problems can be overcome.\n\nFirst, it is true that it might be seen as a stealth tax. One way of solving this issue is to compensate the company accordingly: say for every $1 of additional tax revenue generated by this form of taxation $0.90 of tax is deducted from the corporation tax of the company buying the energy. A company would add up how much their fuel bill had been for the year, the government would calculate how much of that had been due to increased fuel taxes and that amount would then be deductible against income, reducing their income taxes by a level similar to that of the increased costs. And why only a 90% rebate on the tax increase? This is to incentivise companies to reduce their energy consumption.\n\nSecond, it could make industry less competitive as their energy costs would be higher than those in other countries without this tax. This assumption is wrong. Since the tax would be deductible against income, the net impact to the company's post tax profit should be the same as it was without the tax. In addition, because energy costs are a function of energy consumption multiplied by energy prices, and energy prices will always be high, companies will be permanently incentivised to find ways of reducing energy consumption. This effort to reduce energy consumption will mean that they should also be more competitive in other countries where they operate, resulting in a permanent competitive advantage.\n\nThird, aren't higher energy prices a disincentive to new low cost energy supplies? No, not at all. If the global market price for oil is $110 per barrel and you have a way of producing oil at $90 per barrel you will see a profit of $20 per barrel. If the global market price drops to $100 per barrel and the government imposes a $10 per barrel tax there is nothing stopping you from selling at $110 per barrel and maintaining your $20 per barrel profit. As a result, a minimum price floor should prove a boon to new energy companies who should see significantly higher levels of profit than they normally would see, coupled with higher levels of certainty. It will also drive significant innovation in energy efficiency as customers can reduce their energy costs by reducing their energy consumption.\n\nThis policy will introduce much greater economic certainty for the energy sector. Energy consumers will know that the cost of energy will not go down, but that they can save money by being more energy efficient. Energy producers will know that cost reductions will result in greater levels of profit, driving innovation. Energy efficiency companies will do particularly well as anything that they will be able to keep costs low and pass on the benefits to customers. This certainty reduces market risk, reduces the cost of capital and thus allows for greater technical and economic innovation.\n\nThis is good for industry, consumers and the environment.\n\nGreen Is Not Red, But Blue: Environmentalism And The Mystery Of Right Wing Opposition",

The use of conservative \"market based mechanisms\" such as cap and trade for ozone management, emissions trading schemes for carbon dioxide reduction, and renewable obligation certificates for clean energy production made the big government interventions and wealth redistribution of environmentalism palatable.\n\nOver the last six years, however, conservatism has been on the defensive. It no longer appears to be providing the solutions that we need and many of its policies have been actively destructive. The interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan have proven horrifically expensive in terms of money and resources; the credit bubble of the 2000s burst resulting in a great recession and hundred billion dollar bail outs of the great bastions of conservatism - financial institutions. Waves of outsourcing in the early 2000s has resulted in the sudden rise of developing nations, such as nominally socialist China, that are proving better at free trade than the West.\n\nIn this increasingly negative atmosphere, environmentalism seems to be a luxury that we can no longer afford. And worse, in the absence of a general feeling of conservative success, the socialist roots of environmentalism are more exposed. This makes the sector an attractive diversionary target for conservatives seeking to shift public attention away from costly wars, financial bailouts and unemployment.\n\nSo where does this leave us for the future?\n\nFirst, the socialist capture of environmentalism, red becoming green, was a historical accident. There are many aspects of environmentalism that are conservative. Under a different historical set of circumstances blue conservatism could have become green.\n\nSecond, conservatives need to reclaim environmentalism, which the UK Conservative party initially tried to do prior to the most recent general election in May 2010. Leading up to the election they vowed to be the greenest government ever. But failed to deliver.\n\nEnvironmentalism has the following conservative traits:\n\n- National security. Renewable energy is generated domestically and does not require us to be linked to external sources for oil and natural gas. In the European Union an increasing amount of its natural gas supplies comes from Russia, which has proven to be an unreliable source willing to shut off gas supplies for political reasons, and from North Africa and the Middle East, regions that are increasingly unstable. A country that is dominated by renewables would have very little reason to intervene militarily in other parts of the world.\n\nNational security.

A country that is dominated by renewables would have very little reason to intervene militarily in other parts of the world.\n\n- Energy price stability. Businesses like to fix as many parts of their expenditure as they can in long term agreements. This reduces the volatility of their overheads, allowing them to compete on product innovation rather than worry about external events over which they have no control. Wind and solar power farms are very capital intensive - essentially you are paying for 20-25 years of power up front. The advantage is that it is possible for a company to lock itself into a stable 20 year power purchase agreement as the sun and wind are free and are not subject to supply and demand price changes.\n\nEnergy price stability.

Wind farms and solar parks may not require fuel, but they do require maintenance, once built. They employ more people per MW of production than conventional coal, nuclear and gas power stations and typically do so in rural areas, providing steady employment for rural dwellers, who are typically conservatively inclined, and have been for decades.\n\nEmployment.

We are at the start of a major shift in energy production. Coal gave way to oil, oil to gas. Each time a shift occurs there is an opportunity for companies to be created and dominate the next phase of energy. The West kick started this shift to renewables, but recent poor policy choices by Western governments has put this lead advantage under threat with a big shift towards wind and solar manufacturing jobs being created in China. However, even if most solar panels and wind turbine are built in China, the equipment needs to be installed locally, providing scope for employment and innovation.\n\nBusiness innovation.

Climate change is going to change the environment in unpredictable ways. Some places will benefit. It is likely that most will not, with increased floods, droughts and attempts at mass migration causing political, economic and social chaos.\n\nConservatives need to seize the cloak of environmentalism away from socialists and show that green is not red but blue.\n\nRoots: A Historical Understanding Of Climate Change Denial, Creationism And Slavery - 1629-1775",

If the green territories became free states, and the brown territories were not allowed to become slave states, the number of free states would exceed the slave states, enabling anti slavery laws to be passed. This threat was the main driving force for southern secession and thus for the Civil War as the North tried to stop the South from seceding.\n\nIt is worth reminding ourselves that at this point in time the Republicans were the party of the North and the more populated areas, as the map below shows, and that Republicans were anti slavery and Democrats were generally pro slavery.\n\nThe inversion of Republican / Democrat states did not happen until Kennedy (Massachusetts) and Johnson (Texas) stood for election. Johnson realised that his push for Civil Rights for African Americans would alienate the South and would result in the loss of the South for Democrats for a generation. Johnson was right about losing the South, but wrong about how long it would take, as the 2008 Presidential election shows . With the exception of Florida, whose population is boosted by Democratic retirees fleeing the North for warmer weather, the electoral map below looks remarkably like that of the Free / Slave states above.\n\nIf you then look at the demographic of Baptists, who are traditionally more conservative Christians, as a percentage of all residents in 2000, you see an interesting overlap between Baptist church adherence and the South. In addition, Lutherans and Mormons top up modern Republican states in Indiana, Utah, Arizona and North and South Dakota.\n\nUnderstanding religious beliefs is important as the pre Civil War South maintained their belief that slavery was justified by the Bible, based on Genesis 9:25-27. Noah's son, Ham had seen \"the nakedness of his father\", while Noah was passed out, drunk. As a punishment for being humiliated by his son, Noah thought fit to curse Ham's son, Canaan:\n\n\"Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers. He also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem. May God extend the territory of Japheth; may Japeth live in the tents of Shem and may Canaan be his slave'. \"\n\nSince Canaan supposedly then settled in Africa, African people' dark skin became associated with Cannan's curse. Thus, since Noah, who was beloved by God, had cursed Canaan, and Canaan's descendants were black slaves, it was okay for Southern plantation owners to also own black slaves. A perfectly logical conclusion.\n\nEvolution can't happen because the Earth is not old enough\n\nThis same Biblical logic is at work with creationism and why conservative Christians believe evolution cannot exist. The main religious problem with evolution, if you set aside the fact that the Book of Genesis clearly states that Man was created at the same time as all of the beasts and thus fully formed and not evolved, is one of time. Scientists say that evolutionary biology needs a very long time in order for it to work.\n\nEarly geological work in 19th Century Britain was highly controversial as it suggested the age of the Earth as being much older than what Christian research had led everybody to believe: that God had created the Earth at 9am on the 23rd October 4004 BC. Darwin's Theory of Evolution was also radically opposed by leading minds in the late to mid 19th Century Britain. His theories were deemed preposterous as his evolutionary time frame required far longer than what was deemed available.\n\nModern science, which is the bedrock of our industrial and medical society, has presented strong evidence that the Universe is over 13.84 billion years old, that the Earth is over 4.5 billion years old and that evolution is the foundation of all modern biology. Conservative Christians, however, do not accept that the writings in a 3,000-year-old religious document might be wrong.\n\nGlobal warming won't destroy the planet because God promised Noah\n\nCan it be surprising then that conservative Christians deny that climate change is taking place? As with slavery and creationism, conservative Christians have solid Biblical justification for denying climate change. The first good reason is that there are natural cycles and that God promised Noah not to flood the Earth again, as The Cornwall Alliance: For the Stewardship of Creation helpfully points out:\n\nThe natural cycles necessary for human and ecosystem thriving (summer and winter, planting and harvest, cold and heat, day and night) will continue as long as Heaven and Earth endure (Genesis 8:22), and (2) that flood waters will never again cover the Earth (Genesis 9:11- 12, 15-16; Psalm 104:9; Jeremiah 5:22).\n\nIn addition, in order for:\n\nhumanity to fulfill the stipulation of Genesis 1:28 to multiply and to fill, subdue, and rule the Earth--a stipulation repeated in God's covenant with Noah (Genesis 9:1-17)\n\nTherefore, it is contended, mankind cannot have a negative impact on the Earth as it would be contrary to God's commandment. Hence, there should be no concerns about overpopulation. Finally, what God made during the creation of Earth was \"good\" (Genesis 1:31). Thus to suggest that mankind can harm the planet that God has made \"good\" by doing what God has asked mankind to do (fill, subdue and rule the Earth (Genesis 1:28)) clearly cannot make sense. Population growth should be encouraged and the environment cannot be damaged.\n\nThis brings us to our next important question.\n\nWhy is there a North South split in the United States?\n\nWhy are people in the Northern, more populated states, less likely to deny global warming is happening, less likely to believe in creationism and less likely to have supported slavery than people who live in the South? Surely they all came from pretty similar British stock. The answer to that is \"no\" and at this point we turn to one of the finest books on early American history by David Hacket Fischer called Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America (America: A Cultural History) .\n\nFischer does a comparative analysis of four major British settler groups in America and looks back to how they lived in Britain and how they brought their distinctive cultural and social values to the Americas. The book is nearly a 1,000 pages long and a challenge to summarise. However, the four waves of settlers are:\n\n- Wave One, to the North, consisted predominantly of the Puritans from East Anglia who settled in New England between 1629 and 1640, the years immediately preceding the English Civil War in which Oliver Cromwell and the Puritan army defeated and beheaded King Charles I. This group of settlers was dominated by families who had higher levels of literacy and yeomanry than the average, and they were very religious. Socially, they were essentially the same class, with minor variations. While their strong religious beliefs could have kept them on the path of creationism and climate change denial, high levels of literacy and an emphasis on education (eg they founded Harvard University in the US, and some were Cambridge University educated in Britain) made them more receptive to the Enlightenment and concepts of science that were emerging in Britain.\n\nWave One, to the North, consisted predominantly of the Puritans from East Anglia who settled in New England between 1629 and 1640, the years immediately preceding the English Civil War in which Oliver Cromwell and the Puritan army defeated and beheaded King Charles I.

This group brought their concepts of social hierarchy and quasi Roman Catholicism. Future settlers came from the same rich farmlands of England and were frequently the second sons of aristocrats who founded dynasties in America. Washington, Jefferson and General Lee were archetypes. The non-elite typically came over as indentured servants, people who sold their labour in advance for long-term contracts in return for the cost of transport to America. Used to feudalism and semi feudalism back home, slavery as a concept was not hard to adopt when cotton farming made it particularly lucrative. Educating black slaves was at times illegal.\n\nWave Two, to the South, consisted of the defeated (or soon to be defeated) supporters of the king and the (Anglican) Church of England, primarily from the south and west of England, who settled in the Chesapeake Bay regions of Virginia and Maryland between 1642 and 1675.

Educating black slaves was at times illegal.\n\n- Wave Three, to the North, was the migration of Quakers from the English midlands (and their religious kin from various German sects) who settled in the Delaware Valley (southeast Pennsylvania, west New Jersey, north Delaware) between 1675 and 1715. They were socially even more egalitarian than the Puritans. Formal schooling was important. Many of them founded businesses with a social contract, both in Britain and in America. Pacifist in nature (Pennsylvania was one of the last states to vote for independence prior to the Revolution) their views became very dominant in the anti slavery movement of the 1800s and women's rights at the end of the 19th / early 20th centuries. American idealism comes from this group.\n\nWave Three, to the North, was the migration of Quakers from the English midlands (and their religious kin from various German sects) who settled in the Delaware Valley (southeast Pennsylvania, west New Jersey, north Delaware) between 1675 and 1715.

American idealism comes from this group.\n\n- Wave Four, to the South, were the \"Scotch-Irish\", referring collectively to immigrants from the north of England, lowland Scotland, and Ulster who settled the Appalachian backcountry from Pennsylvania southwest through Virginia, the Carolinas, and into Tennessee and Kentucky from 1717 to 1775. They were less homogenous in religion than the prior waves. The Scotch-Irish settlers were a mixture of Presbyterians, the dominant group, and Anglicans, a significant minority. Their home territories were the least developed in Britain and historic blood feuding between massively extended family networks were not uncommon. One of their key characteristics was the desire to be left alone by government, and they held strong views about the rights of States vs the US Federal government.\n\nWave Four, to the South, were the \"Scotch-Irish\", referring collectively to immigrants from the north of England, lowland Scotland, and Ulster who settled the Appalachian backcountry from Pennsylvania southwest through Virginia, the Carolinas, and into Tennessee and Kentucky from 1717 to 1775.

Catholics from Ireland, Poland and Italy, accompanied by Christian Orthodox beliefs from eastern Europe and Russia, settled heavily in the North East.\n\nHowever, the establishment of an industrial, egalitarian, educated class in the North and a more rural, less equal and less educated class in the South had already formed the bedrock of their respective societies.\n\nIt is by understanding our history that we can best understand the present.\n\nBy understanding the present we are able to understand how our societies will develop in the future.\n\nCassandra: Time To Give Up On Predicting Climate Change?",

By 1847 there were 15 slave and 14 free states. The North had the majority of the population and thus greater control over Congress, but each state had only two senators, effectively allowing the slave states to block any anti slavery legislation.\n\nBut the North had a trump card: expansion of the number of states. Following the 1836 Texas declaration of independence from Mexico and the 1846 -7 Mexican war with the United States, a whole number of new states could be created. If those states were free states, the balance of power in the Senate would swing away from the South, making it more likely that both Congress and the Senate would pass bills banning slavery. With the victory of Lincoln and the Republicans in 1860, on an anti slavery platform, the writing was on the wall. Preemptively, before Lincoln had even been inaugurated, many of the Southern states seceded from the Union, setting the stage for the American Civil War.\n\nThe struggle over slavery had become a struggle over the way of life for people in the South. And yet, very few of the 5 million whites in the South were large slave owners: 48,000 had more than 20 slaves. Very large slave owners numbered in the hundreds and were the richest and most politically powerful men in their communities. Defence of slavery became synonymous with a defence of Southern life and values. Morality was completely thrown out of the window and the more the North looked as though it was going to win the battle for black slaves the more the South reacted against it.\n\nToday, we live in a world that still abounds with morally suspect choices. We still do things that we know are damaging for us all. We destroy habitats, rain forests, kill dolphins, whales, great apes, tigers and other endangered species. The science about climate change is unambiguous: the planet is getting hotter and mankind is the cause. Fisheries are on the verge of collapse around the world. And yet there are a vocal number of people who stand up against the onslaught of history and push for more oil, gas and coal and push back against renewables. There are people who push for more subsidies for large factory fishing vessels and even higher quotas for catches. Like the Southern States there are rich, powerful vested interests who want to maintain the status quo and like the Southern States there are millions of poor who support and identify with their cause, despite gaining no financial benefit.\n\nThis struggle between economically vested interests pursuing morally dubious choices does not have to end, like the United States, in conflict. The Civil War also showed us that people can go directly against their economic interest if they can be persuaded to put morality first. The Confederate South believed from the outset that Great Britain would support them in the war: it was British cotton mills that purchased the bulk of the 4 million bales of cotton that the South produced every year. They calculated that it would be disastrous for the mill owners if they could not get the raw ingredients to feed their mills.\n\nThey were wrong. The anti slavery movement was so strong that Britain turned its back on Southern cotton. Some mills did do badly, others found alternative sources.\n\nThey adjusted, and so should we",

      "full_text": "The advent of cheap renewable energy and battery storage has already started to change the world. It is not an exaggeration to call this change a \"revolution\". Some companies and countries will make it through this revolution stronger and better. Many will fail.\n\nIf you are a leader in an energy related company or a government minister you need to understand the dynamics of this revolution in order to manage your way through this transition. History Future Now has worked in the energy sector for over 20 years in a career that has included coal and natural gas power stations, oil refineries, and renewable energy such as solar, wind, tidal, wave, biomass, biofuels and heat recovery systems.\n\nIn this article History Future Now is going to briefly describe the energy revolution that is taking place and will then go back in time to look at how other leaders managed the previous energy revolutions of coal and oil. What did they do right? Where did they go wrong? We will then move forward in time and see how the changes taking place today are likely to impact our future.\n\nThe Renewables and Battery Revolution\n\nThe current energy revolution combines renewable energy and battery technology. There are many types of renewable energy, including wave energy, tidal energy, biomass energy and biofuels. But the key renewables are solar and wind. Why? In certain parts of the world they are now the cheapest form of electricity available, without any subsidies. To be clear: this means that they are cheaper on a cost per kilowatt hour than oil, diesel, coal, natural gas and nuclear power alternatives.\n\nAs the cost of solar and wind energy continues to drop, they will become the cheapest form of energy in most countries. Even in countries where they are not yet the cheapest form of electricity, they are having a significant impact on the electricity market. Utility companies in northern Europe are no longer developing new coal or natural gas powered power stations. Why? It takes 10 years to develop, build and commission a power station and takes 15-20 years before there is a payback on the capital spent. Based on existing price points, it is highly probable that solar and wind will be cheaper than conventional power long before that time, which will leave those new power stations uneconomic to run. Why bother building in the first place? This is why many people in the renewables industry are not that concerned by President Trump's energy policies. While he may like coal and may think that climate change is a Chinese hoax perpetrated on the West, the investment committees of utilities will be making a simple calculation as to whether they agree to fund the construction of a new coal power plant: will it be competitive in the long run? And the answer is \"No\". Even if President Trump were to subsidise coal and to penalise renewables, few investment committees would be willing to gamble that those policies would last the next 25-30 years before a power station has reached a payback on their capital. The answer will still be \"No\".\n\nThere is a problem, however. Solar and wind energy have a well known Achilles heel: when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow they don't generate power. Oddly, this is not an insurmountable problem. Solar and and wind are relatively asynchronous: when it is sunny, there is not as much wind and when it is windy, there is not as much sun. They complement each other. But you will get periods of time when there is no wind and no sun.\n\nThere are other ways of dealing with this. Firstly, not all electricity users need to have power all the time. Some large electricity users, factories for example, are paid to reduce their electricity demand at certain times, so that supply and demand can match more evenly. Another option is for special, fast reacting, power stations - called peakers- to switch on at peak times to provide more electricity to balance supply.\n\nFinally, the electricity grids of many countries and regions are linked by high capacity power lines so that electricity can flow between regions; from Germany to Denmark, for example, when there is a drop-off in wind supply.\n\nEven so, despite all of these coping mechanisms, wind and solar cannot provide all the power to all countries all the time. This is where batteries come in. Lithium ion batteries are the standard form of battery used today in electric vehicles and electronic devices such as smartphones and computers. They are also increasingly being used as back up power for renewable energy. It is obvious why this makes sense. If you can store the energy from solar and wind energy and release it when it is needed it solves the problem described above.\n\nBatteries have other advantages over existing peaking plants: they don't need fuel; can be mass produced in a factory and are thus very fast to deploy; and are nearly instantaneous in their ability release energy. However, while battery back up systems are being deployed, they are still expensive and the economics are tight.\n\nNevertheless, everyone in the industry believes that the cost of batteries will continue to fall very rapidly, in the same way that solar PV costs have plummeted over the past 5-10 years. Why do they think this? Battery technology has two major bulk markets - electric vehicles and storage for electricity. Both are massive potential markets and advances in one market will spur on innovation and drive down costs in the other market. Tesla, for example offers not only an electric vehicle - powered by a battery - but also home battery storage for solar PV. Elon Musk believes that the home battery storage market will be larger than the electric vehicle market and yet it is fundamentally the same technology.\n\nThis is in contrast with the existing energy markets: coal and natural gas is heavily used in electricity production but barely used for transportation while oil is heavily used in transportation but barely used in electricity production. Neither renewables nor battery technology are ideal on their own. But as a hybrid they are very powerful and will fundamentally reshape the energy landscape. Before we look to the future, we are going to go back in time to see how companies and countries responded to the two previous energy revolutions.\n\nThe shift to coal\n\nMost readers will know that the first industrial revolution was based on steam power that was created through the burning of coal. Many will not know, however, that it was desire to dig coal out of the ground to be used as a regular household fuel that created the impetus for the steam revolution in the first place.\n\nBy the late 1700s England was suffering from widespread deforestation. Most of the fuel used to heat homes was wood. The growing population needed more wood but there was only a finite amount of wood available, which was being cut down. The Napoleonic Wars, which started shortly after the French Revolution in 1789, increased the demand for oak, which was used for building ships, and triggered even more deforestation. A single warship could consume 6,000 oak trees.\n\nTo solve this fuel crisis people started to dig out coal from the ground. The fact that coal could be burned as a fuel was well understood. In an era of abundant wood there was no point in spending the effort of digging it out of the ground. It was also a less desirable fuel to burn. But, as less wood became available, people started to mine for coal. This was hard work, made more difficult due to the fact that the coal mines would quickly become flooded with groundwater, which needed to be pumped out.\n\nThe very first steam engines were created to drive pumps, fuelled by the coal from the mines that they were pumping out. As the mines got deeper and more complex, wood timbers were used support tunnels, which further exasperated the deforestation crisis. Eventually, steam engines were adapted to drive a range of industrial processes and became light enough to be mounted on wheels, bringing about the steam train and ship revolutions.\n\nFrom the perspective of a company or a country these changes were profound, but not obvious at the outset. Coal was not as good as wood. It was hard to dig out of the ground, while trees were easy to cut down. Once a seam of coal had been mined, it was gone, while trees grew back. You needed a series of expensive, additional inventions that did not yet exist, such as steam powered pumps, in order to maximise the output of a mine. Worst of all, consumers disliked coal and preferred using wood. If you had asked a company to invest in coal at the outset, before large-scale deforestation and before the steam powered pump, the answer would likely have been \"No\". But those companies that did embrace the change and harnessed the opportunities unleashed by coal became very wealthy.\n\nThe shift to coal had a profound impact on the world economy, beyond being a substitute for burning wood for heating. The first companies to develop technologies based on coal were in Western Europe and the United States. While coal was not as appealing for heating homes, it was more energy dense and could burn hotter than wood, which was critical to many industrial processes such as creating large quantities of low cost iron or driving the machines needed to manufacture high quality, low cost, goods and textiles.\n\nThis, in turn, shifted the economic and political balance of power around the world. The West was able to flood the rest of the world with cheap, high quality manufactured goods. Many of the islands around the world that are still owned by European countries and the US today are vestiges of the coal era as they were used to store coal reserves for steam ships to refuel with on their way to sell goods to Asia. China and India, once manufacturing powerhouses, reeled under the onslaught of these cheap products. Attempts to put up trade barriers to protect their domestic industries were pushed aside as Western countries used the iron clad ships and mass produced modern weaponry to force free trade. It has taken China and India nearly 200 years to recover from this imbalance of power that was triggered by the shift from wood to coal.\n\nThe shift to oil\n\nOil today is predominantly used for transportation and to create a range of chemicals needed for other industrial processes. But it did not start off by being used for those purposes; its major use was as a medical ointment. Like coal, people were aware of the existence of oil for thousands of years - Herodotus makes a reference to it over 2,500 years ago. But, also like coal, there was no demand to do anything with this black sticky substance that seeped out of the ground in various parts of the world.\n\nThe modern demand for oil came about as oil derived from the blubber of whales started to run out. Whale oil was predominantly used for lighting purposes, either as lamp oil or for candles. Whales had been hunted commercially since the 1400s. Basque fishermen, for example, caught northern right whales as they went to breed in the Bay of Biscay. These large mammals went to sleep on the surface and, when killed, would float, making them easy to catch and handle.\n\nThe Dutch and the English became major whalers in the early 1600s and the American colonists joined them in the late 1600s and 1700s. The first sperm whale was caught in 1712, which ushered in a new wave of hunting as factory whaling ships went far out into the Atlantic, and then the Pacific, to hunt and then render whale blubber down to oil onboard. This allowed ships to stay out at sea for months at a time and rapidly increased the number of whales a ship could catch.\n\nBy the 1860s the population of whales had been decimated, which provided the impetus for entrepreneurs to find substitutes for this lucrative trade. In the early 1840s a Scottish chemist realised that if you distilled oil it was possible to create a number of useful products from the original oil, ranging from a liquid that could be used for lamp oil - which he dubbed paraffin oil - to a thicker liquid that could be used as a lubricant. In 1850 a Canadian geologist created another process that extracted oil from coal, bitumen and shale, which he called kerosene. In 1859 Edwin Drake drilled the first modern oil well in Pennsylvania and the oil industry as we know it today was started.\n\nThe oil revolution had a beneficial impact on the whale population, which was being driven into extinction, as it reduced the demand for whale oil, which rapidly became more expensive than paraffin oil and kerosene. It is also worth remembering that whale oil stank, making it quite unpleasant. But the modern era would not have emerged had the oil revolution simply been a substitution of whale oil for petroleum based oils, in the same way that the coal revolution was not simply a substitution of wood for coal for heating.\n\nOil quickly became used for other activities. It was light, easily transportable and very energy dense. As a liquid it could be stored and piped very efficiently. This made it ideal as a substitute for coal in transportation and certain forms of machinery. A lot of individuals and companies made great fortunes during this era as oil moved from being a source of clean light to a source of advanced mobility.\n\nOil has had a profound impact on geopolitics. The First World War was predominantly fought using steam engines to transport troops along railroads and horses to bring supplies to the front. While petrol based motor cars existed and biplanes flew over the battlefields they were not in widespread use. The shift to the Dreadnaught class battleship, fuelled by oil, did have a significant impact on the navies of both Britain and Germany during the war.\n\nDuring the interwar period great advances were made in both the discovery of oil reserves around the world and in the use of oil as a means of transport. One of the great \"what ifs\" in history is the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia. Prior to the First World War most of the Arabian peninsula and what is now Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, had been directly or indirectly part of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the war the Ottoman Empire had been carved up into smaller countries, of which Turkey was the most populous. In 1922 King Ibn Saud met with a mining engineer to explore for oil in eastern Arabia. Over the next decade other Western companies, including Standard Oil, got rights to explore the area. Oil was discovered in Bahrain in 1932 and in 1938 a major oil field was finally discovered in Saudi Arabia. Had the Ottoman Empire not collapsed when it did, or had oil been discovered in the Persian Gulf region earlier, the Ottoman Empire would have been in a radically different financial and strategic position, which may have allowed it to survive to this day.\n\nThe Second World War was driven by oil. At the beginning of the First World War Paris was about to fall. French General Gallieni commandeered all of the taxis in Paris to drive soldiers to the front line in order reinforce the line against the invading German armies. It became very clear how important oil and motor cars were going to be for the military. In 1940 the Americans and British, Chinese and Dutch imposed an embargo on the export of oil and other raw materials to Japan, as a result of the Japanese occupation of much of China. Japan had no indigenous oil reserves and without the oil its military would soon grind to a halt. This embargo was the direct cause of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941. Germany, also had its own oil problems. Like Japan, it had no indigenous oil resources. Once the war got started in earnest it constantly faced oil shortages, which significantly impacted its ability to wage war.\n\nIn the Post War period oil has continued to have a major impact on the geopolitical order. By the late 1960s oil production from the Middle East, and from Saudi Arabia in particular, was so large that political events in 1973 - the Yom Kippur War - and in 1979 - the Iranian Revolution - caused a significant economic impact on the major industrialised nations. These oil shocks triggered a response in the West to become more energy efficient and to seek other forms of supply. Norway and Great Britain developed oil and gas resources in the North Sea and Mexico, Venezuela, Alaska and Texas all became major oil producers.In 1990 there was a smaller, less dramatic, oil shock caused by the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein. This resulted in a series of unforeseen consequences that still resonate nearly thirty years later. Frightened about the long term impact of Iraq absorbing Kuwait and the risk of an invasion of Saudi Arabia, the US and other Western powers formed a coalition to liberate Kuwait.\n\nThe presence of large numbers of western troops in Saudi Arabia during and after the 1990 Gulf War caused much concern among very religious Saudis. American troops were deemed as occupiers and the demand for all Western troop to evacuate the Gulf region was one of the reasons behind Osama bin Ladin's attack on the US mainland on 11 September 2001. This then highlighted the possible impact of terrorist attacks on Western soil which prompted the Iraq War in 2003 to overthrow Saddam Hussain, who was suspected of building stocks of weapons of mass destruction that could be used against the West at any time. That war, plus the campaign in Afghanistan, dragged on until 2011, before being replaced by civil war and the rise of ISIS. Since then the West has been targeted multiple times by muslim terrorists.\n\nThus the last 100 years have seen oil play a major role geopolitically. Its impact was felt in the First World War and was one of the causes of the Second World War (Germany only declared war on the United States after the Japanese had attached Pearl Harbour). It has resulted in a huge transfer of wealth from industrialised countries to the Middle Easter oil producing nations and has triggered wars and terrorist actions that have lasted nearly 30 years.Oil did not fully replace coal and coal did not fully replace wood. In the same way, the renewables and battery revolution will not replace oil. But the geopolitical impact will be just as profound.\n\nThe shift to renewables and batteries\n\nRenewables have existed for centuries. Waterwheels were used by the Romans and wind power was used by the Dutch in the 1600s for a range of activities such as pumping water to drain the land, grinding pigments for paints and sawing wood for ship building. Solar photovoltaics, which is the key driver of the current revolution, are relatively new and became vaguely commercial in the 1970s for specific applications such as electric calculators or powering satellites and remote equipment.\n\nIt was only after the 1970s oil shocks, however, that industrialised countries started to put significant amounts of money into the research and development of solar and wind energy. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, raised the alarm that coal and oil usage was changing the climate significantly. After Rio many Western countries introduced a range of mechanisms and subsidies to encourage the commercial deployment of renewable energy in order to curb and replace demand for coal and oil.\n\nBattery technology has also been around for a long time. In 1800 Alessandro Volta (he of \"volts\") created the first battery made out of copper and zinc discs separated by paper soaked in brine. Battery technology was adapted to be used in electric cars in 1884 when Thomas Parker produced an electric car and in 1888 another electric car was produced by the German Andrew Flocken. Had there been no whale oil crisis there might not have been a big push for oil based paraffin oil for lamps which means that there might not have been a widespread supply of petroleum for cars. It is remarkable to realise that there is a historical thread that links Moby Dick to World War 2 to ISIS.\n\nThe combination of renewables and batteries will have a number of profound impacts on existing companies, the world economy and the geopolitical balance of power.\n\nImpact on incumbents\n\nThere are two groups of incumbents that should worry most about the renewables and batteries revolution. Companies and countries that produce and make use of fossil fuels. Lets start with companies first.\n\nThe incumbent transportation and electricity companies\n\nAll of the major car manufacturers now have serious plans to roll out electric vehicles, in part spurred on by Tesla, which showed that there was a market for high performance electric cars like the Model S and the Model X and for mass market vehicles like the Model 3. Early electric cars had poor battery range of less than 100 miles. Most of the new vehicles being sold in the market now or planned for release in 2018 and onwards have ranges that are are between 200 and 350 miles - more than enough to deal with the \"range anxiety\" that put off many potential buyers of electric cars.\n\nElectric vehicles have a number of benefits over conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. They perform better than most ICE powered vehicles in terms of acceleration, due to the torque generated by electric motors, and road handling, due to the low centre of gravity. They will be convenient to charge, either at home, at work or on the motorway, so there will be no need to travel to a filling station to recharge. For city dwellers and governments they have the added benefit of producing no emissions - which is becoming a major health concern in urban areas.\n\nElectric vehicles are also likely be more reliable that ICE powered cars. There are very few moving parts. This is bad news for anybody involved in maintaining vehicles. Finally, electric charging will create significantly more flexibility for powering autonomous vehicles. While it is possible for an ICE to provide the power for an autonomous vehicle it will be harder to manage than electric vehicles over time.\n\nThese innovations and developments at the car level has spurred on the development of electric car charging companies which are laying the infrastructure for the mass charging of electric cars. This is bad news for all companies that are involved in the production, processing and sale of fuels for automotive transport.\n\nOver the past few years millions of homes in the US and Europe have had solar photovoltaic panels installed on their roofs. This decentralised power has started to cause issues with utilities, who have expressed concern that houses are not paying enough for the electricity that they are using from the grid when the sun is not shining. The problem utilities have is that it is expensive to maintain the electricity grid. The grid is paid for by users. So, if there are not enough users, there won't be enough money to pay for the grid. Utilities have responded to this problem by calling for houses to pay a higher standing charge to cover the grid cost, which has increased the cost for households.\n\nBattery technology solves this problem for households - if all of your power requirements can be met by solar power that is stored in batteries during the day, you can have power at night. The cost of the battery can be offset by the cost of the grid standing charge, which householders don't want to pay. As more households switch to battery storage the cost for the remaining households to maintain the grid will go up, which will make the switch to battery storage even more appealing. This turns into a vicious, or virtuous depending on your viewpoint, circle.\n\nIn the meantime, most of the new installations of electrical power in developed countries today are renewables, either solar or wind. Traditionally, it was electricity utilities that built, owned and operated centralised fossil fuel power stations. This required relatively few generating assets manned by relatively few people. These centralised facilities were very complex to design, build and operate. It was an industry dominated by specialists.Interestingly, if you look at the historic shareholding register of many of these electricity utilities - and oil majors - you will find that they were predominantly owned by pension and insurance funds. Why? It is because utilities and oil majors have traditionally been very reliable payers of dividends. Dividends provide a great income for retired people. But there is a growing set of problems emerging for utilities. Firstly, many utilities are in terrible financial trouble, in part due to the fact that large scale wind and solar photovoltaics are able to offer day time power at incredibly low rates. Historically, day time power was the peak profit making part of the day for utilities. Second, they are facing higher costs related to decommissioning of old power plants and taxes linked to emissions and CO2. With lower revenues and higher costs it is increasingly difficult to pay out dividends. There is a final problem for utilities: pension funds and insurance companies are realising that it is not that difficult to own and operate a wind or solar farm. Unlike a coal power station, with its complex supply arrangements and operations, it is relatively easy to run a solar farm. As a result, financial institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies are now the largest owners of wind and solar assets in the world. Not the traditional utilities. This shift will have major implications on oil and gas majors and utilities. The incumbents will suffer and new entrants, who will certify and manage solar and wind installations on behalf of financial institutions will flourish.\n\nThe combination of large scale solar and wind energy with battery technology is going to be the nail in the coffin for the traditional utilities. It is incredibly hard for utilities to make the transition to this new world. They are heavily encumbered by staff and pension liabilities and ageing power stations. Their cost of capital is much higher than that of a pension fund, so they will always be more expensive. You can see this problem reflected in their share prices. RWE, a major German utility, had a high of around EUR 100 per share in 2008 and has seen its price slide almost every year since. It is now at EUR 14 per share. EON, another Germany utility, had a share price of around EUR 50 per share in 2008 and has slid down to EUR 7 per share. EDF, of France, has seen its share price drift down from over EUR 80 per share in 2008 to EUR 8 per share.\n\nThe incumbent countries for fossil fuels\n\nWhile it is sad to see individual companies that have been successful for decades wither away, they are just companies. As they die shareholders will drift away and will invest money in new companies that will make it through the energy transition. Employees will also move over to more exiting opportunities.The impact on countries that produce fossil fuels will be far more dramatic.\n\nFirst, it is important to emphasise that History Future Now does not think that the renewables and battery revolution will kill off coal, oil and natural gas. That is not the case. They will exist for a long time to come. Oil and natural gas are both used extensively as the feedstock for many chemical processes, plastics and synthetic materials. Parachutes, safety glass, toilet seats, fishing rods, toothbrushes, perfumes, roads, aspirin, deodorant, tires, fertilisers. They all are made from petroleum products. The list goes on and on and on. Coal also has a range of industrial applications. It is used for making steel, alumina - for aluminium, agricultural fertilisers, nitric acid, dyes, plastics, carbon fibre and silicone metal which is used for lubricants, toothpaste and hair shampoo. These products are massively valuable to modern life and it is almost inconceivable that we would be able to live without them.\n\nWe will just stop burning them. Most coal, oil and natural gas is burnt as a fuel to generate heat. That heat can either drive pistons directly, as with an internal combustion engine, or indirectly, by boiling water to create steam which then drives a rotating engine connected to an electricity generator. In a world where most transport is derived from wind and solar electricity powering batteries for electric vehicles and most electricity is from wind and solar energy powering batteries, it does not take much to believe that we will reach the effective end of the fossil fuel age within the next 20 to 40 years.\n\nThe countries most affected by the decline in oil use are clearly those whose economies are most linked to the production of oil. The World Bank provides a good overview of this. The most affected countries are in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Angola, Gabon and the Congo are particularly affected, with over 30% of their GDP linked to oil and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Oman have 40-50% of their GDPs linked to oil. By way of comparison, the US - one of the world's biggest producers of oil - only has 0.4% of its GDP linked to oil and Norway, with its small population, has nearly 6% of its GDP linked to oil. In contrast, coal plays only a small percentage of the GDP of most countries, including major coal producers. Australia, despite being a big coal exporter, has only 0.8% of its economy linked to coal. The highest GDP percentage linked to coal is Mongolia with 5.6%.\n\nSo it would be fair to say that a drop in oil demand will result in a drop in oil revenues for many countries that are already vulnerable. The World Bank map below shows the percentage of a country's population between the ages of 0 and 14 years old. Most of the world's youth children are now living in Africa and the Middle East. Many of these countries have significant percentages of their wealth tied up in oil. Where will Iraq, for example, with about 40% of its wealth linked to oil, find the money to educate its young population - 41% of whom are under 14? It is also clear that the power and influence currently wielded by oil producing countries will fade away. No one will be interested in fighting wars in the Middle East over a resource that no one wants.\n\nThe newcomers. The companies that will win\n\nWe have discussed the impact on the incumbents - both companies and countries. What about the winners in the renewables and battery revolution? Lets think back to the coal and oil revolutions. Coal was introduced as a replacement for wood for heating homes. It ended up providing the fuel for the industrialisation of the West with massive steam powered machines producing a range of manufactured goods that were transported on coal powered steam railways and steam ships across the world. Oil was introduced as a replacement for whale oil for lighting homes. It ended up providing the fuel that enabled new modes of lightweight personalised transport; cars, trucks, and airplanes. It also became the raw feedstock for thousands of different products.\n\nRenewables and batteries clearly have a starting point. They are replacing coal and natural gas in the generation and storage of electricity and oil in the powering of cars and trucks. It is likely that any company that is involved in these activities will end up as a winner. Clearly this means electric vehicle makers plus all of the supply chain companies necessary for the manufacture and assembly of electric vehicles. It also means companies involved in the production and supply chains for wind and solar energy. Battery makers and all of their supply chain, including raw materials producers such as lithium, will benefit. It also means companies involved in financing, advising and setting the standards for them.\n\nBut as coal and oil started as simple substitutes for existing needs, but became much much more, renewables and batteries are also likely to create dozens of new industries that do not, or barely, exist today. We are already getting some glimpses of the future.For example, battery powered quadrocopters have evolved from being toys to being used for inspection devices for difficult to reach locations such as bridges, replacements for helicopters in film making and policing to collecting data on farms to then moderate the use of fertilisers and pesticides. Some quadrocopters are being developed as flying vehicles for passenger transport and as delivery vehicles for packages. These are all new uses for batteries that upend existing industries and make new industries possible.\n\nAnother example is the electrification of rural parts of developing countries where there is no electric grid infrastructure. Renewables and batteries make the grid unnecessary. Why build a very expensive gas fired power station with a grid when it is cheaper to have a solar or wind farm near users with no electricity grid at all? How about using high flying quadrocopters tethered to solar power and battery chargers on the ground to act as low cost mobile phone \"towers\"?\n\nWhy own a car at all if autonomous electric vehicles can provide you with transport whenever you need? If the cost of electricity from renewables is next to nothing it would make sense to charge peak pricing at certain times of day and to provide low cost transport for the rest of the day, ensuring the vehicles - which have low maintenance costs per mile - are constantly used and generating income.\n\nThe newcomers. The countries that will win\n\nIf oil producing and exporting countries are the big losers, which countries will be the big winners? Solar, wind and batteries can be split into multiple value buckets.\n\nOne bucket is the manufacture of these systems. A big difference between old and new energy is that conventional power is typically large and bespoke while renewables are modular and mass produced. This is clearly an advantage that China and other countries that can mass produce items will have.\n\nA second bucket is the deployment, financing and servicing of batteries and renewables. This will be dominated by local players on the deployment side, while financial institutions and the original equipment manufacturers could do well on the financing and servicing side. This is good for both any country that deploys renewables and batteries.\n\nA final bucket is for new products and services that make use of renewable and battery technology - think DHL and Amazon in delivery services, for example. That can be done by both local companies and multinationals, benefiting multiple countries.\n\nAs renewables and batteries are deployed in large volumes a big chunk of value will go to China. They produced the goods, in the same way that Australia currently exports coal and Saudi Arabia exports oil. Ultimately, however, it is the services that are added and created by these technologies that will create real value. The West still has a big advantage in that, though many parts of the world are catching up.\n\nHumanity. The ultimate winner\n\nThere is one final winner in all of this. And that is humanity. The burning of fossil fuels is already changing the climate. The only way to get off burning fossil fuels is for there to be a better alternative. And that alternative now exists. It will take time for renewables and battery technology to fully displace the old system - but due to the mass production capability it will happen faster than many people imagine. That is good, despite being be a little late to mitigate against fossil fuel pollution that has already been released. Renewables and batteries are highly decentralised forms of power. That is good for reducing corruption in poor countries and for reducing massive money transfers from resource poor to resource rich countries.\n\nThis revolution will change things for a lot of companies and a lot of countries. Change is always hard to manage. But overall, the renewables and battery revolution is a good thing and something for all of us to embrace.\n\nBig European electricity utilities are facing an existential crisis.

      "full_text": "The COP26 climate conference held in November 2021 reiterated the need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, and to stop the average global temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels.\n\nUnfortunately, few people are convinced that we will meet that target. Greta Thunberg dismissed the politicians for doing nothing more than saying \"bla bla bla\" and analysis of the various pledges suggest that a minimum increase of 2.4 degrees above pre-industrial levels is almost a certainty, bringing with it serious climate problems.\n\nThere is no doubt, the task ahead is huge. But there is good news, thanks to an emerging technical convergence which is unifying the power sector, transport sector and agriculture sector into one mega electricity sector that feeds off itself, driving down costs for all. This article explains this convergence.\n\nPower and transport\n\nAbout fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from the power sector, to produce electricity, and from the transportation sector, to move goods and people around. Thanks to renewables and battery electric vehicles, there is now a very clear path to being vaguely close to net zero for both those sectors. Globally, more solar and wind energy systems are being installed than fossil fuel based systems and the major car manufacturers are releasing battery electric vehicles that appeal to the mass market. Demand outstrips supply. More needs to be done. To accelerate this development, governments have to make planning permission and grid connections easier for solar and wind farms and for electric charging stations for vehicles. Stopping subsidies to fossil fuel companies and switching those subsidies to renewables and battery electric vehicles would also help.\n\nSteel and cement\n\nThe bad news is that the remaining fifty percent of emissions come from the steel, cement and agricultural sectors. These are much harder to reduce.\n\nThe first two amount to about 18% of global emissions. Steel uses coal to improve purity levels and cement produces CO2 as a by-product in its actual manufacture. It is hard to get away from producing CO2.\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture and food production, which amounts to about 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, are also very hard to decarbonise. There are two main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.\n\nThe first is methane, which is predominantly emitted from the digestive systems of ruminants such as cows and sheep, and from manure. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and captures 28 times more heat than carbon dioxide.\n\nThe second source is nitrous oxide, which comes from changes in the soil due to deforestation and crop production. Nitrous oxide is an even worse greenhouse gas and captures 298 times more heat than carbon dioxide.\n\nIf you look at the sources of emissions in the agriculture and food production sector in more detail you can see that about half comes from deforestation and growing plants for human and animal consumption.\n\nAbout a third comes from belching ruminants, land based fish farms and manure. Finally, about twenty percent comes from the food supply chain, which includes processing, packing, transport and retail outlets.\n\nThere are some relatively easy wins. For example, stopping eating anything associated with ruminants would help, a lot. This means taking lamb and beef off the menu and also stopping eating dairy products. If you feel the need to eat meat, chicken and pork are significantly better alternatives, from a greenhouse gas perspective.\n\nThe supply chain could be tightened up, but it will be hard. Transport, which could be electrified to a major extent, only represents 6% of agriculture emissions. The remaining 14% is harder to cut.\n\nSo what about the fifty odd percent from deforestation and land use for growing plants? Given the fact that the global population is increasing and global warming will make farming harder, due to droughts and irregular rainfall, it would suggest that even more deforestation is likely in order to keep up with demand. That would, in turn, contribute to more nitrous oxide emissions, not less.\n\nVertical farming to the rescue, eventually\n\nThere might be a \"get out of jail card\", however; vertical farming. Vertical farming is incredibly efficient when it comes to land use. A four acre vertical farm building can produce the same amount of food as 1,000 acres of conventional farm land. This is due to the fact that vertical farms grow food on multiple levels and they can produce more harvests per year as they are always in the peak growing \"season\", with the same amount of light, water and nutrients 365 days per year.\n\nVertical farming is also extremely efficient when it comes to water use and typically uses about 3-4% of the water of a conventional farm. This is because the water is on a closed loop and any water that is not used is simply captured and recycled to be used again. This makes vertical farming particularly attractive in areas where conventional farming would be near impossible, such as in very arid parts of North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThere are two additional environmental benefits to vertical farming. The first is that they do not need pesticides, insecticides and fungicides which can then drift off the farm and into non farming areas, causing problems with wildlife. Second, unlike conventional farming, it does not release huge amounts of nitrates into the water courses. Excessive nitrate release creates algae blooms in rivers which eventually drift out to sea, causing large dead zones where fish cannot survive.\n\nSo vertical farming is attractive. But could we grow rice, wheat and soy in vertical farms at a price point that is competitive with field grown crops?\n\nThe answer, today, is no. Not a hope.\n\nVertical farms are relatively new and most existing farms are only able to sell salads and herbs at a premium to field grown crops. They would need to improve their economics by a factor of about 100 in order to grow rice, wheat and soy.\n\nWhy vertical farming economics will improve\n\nBut improving the economics of vertical farming by a factor of 100 is actually a realistic target. If you take the production costs of a modern vertical farm and split it into 100 units, 80 units comes from electricity, which is predominantly consumed by LED lights, 15 units comes from labour and 5 units comes from everything else, including water, seeds and nutrients.\n\nThe good news is that a significant drop in the electrical cost is possible by reducing the purchase price of electricity and improving the efficiency of the lights.\n\nIn the UK, the average price of grid electricity is around 12-16 pence per kilowatt hour. In sunny parts of the world it is possible to generate electricity from solar farms using private wires, bypassing grid costs, at around 1.5 pence per kilowatt hour. Over the next ten to fifteen years, as solar and wind become even more efficient, that cost will go to below 1 pence per kilowatt hour in sunny and windy areas and will drop to less than 3 pence per kilowatt hour in places such as the UK. So you can see how that 80 units of cost related to electricity could drop to less than 8 units of cost, over time.\n\nThe second component of the electricity cost is the consumption of electricity. LED lights for vertical farms are a relatively niche market, compared to LED lights for regular lighting needs in homes and businesses. As a result, they are more expensive to buy and are less efficient. The most advanced LED lights can be found in mobile phone displays. They have millions of LEDs which are both very bright and consume very little power. Changes in the overall LED market trickle down into the vertical farming LED market. For example, the cost of buying LED lights for vertical farms has dropped by a factor of 6 in the last three years. The light output has increased by more than 70% and the efficiency has improved by 33%. If you were to just look at the efficiency improvement you could estimate that in ten years that 80 units of cost related electricity could drop to less than 8 units of cost. That reduction, combined with renewables means that the overall cost for electricity could go from 80 units to less than 1 unit in ten years. This would bring the overall cost of vertical farming from 100 units to 21 units.\n\nThe next major cost for a vertical farm is labour. Here too you can see the benefits of scale and efficiency. Farm 1, owned by Fischer Farms, a UK based vertical farming company, needs 3 growers for 3,200m2 of growing space. The company's second farm, which is under construction, needs 7 growers for 25,000m2 of growing space. The extension to the second farm will see the farm increase to 10 growers for 50,000m2 of growing space. That is a 4.7x improvement in efficiency, taking that 15 units of cost down to 3.2 units of cost. Over the next ten years the efficiency will improve further, making it possible to drive this cost down to less than 1 unit of cost. This would mean that the overall cost would drop from 100 units to 7 units, assuming no improvement in water efficiency, seed and nutrient costs.\n\nThe final key driver for improving vertical farm economics is by improving yields. Over the past two years Fischer Farms has increased the yield of some of its crops by a factor of five, using the same seeds. It has done this by creating a climate that is more and more perfect for growing crops. In this new Eden, crops have everything they want. The perfect light, the perfect water, the perfect air speed, the perfect nutrients. There is a lot more that can be done and it is plausible that over the next ten years yields could improve by a factor of ten.\n\nMultiply the cost and yield improvements to each other and you can see the economics of vertical farming improving by a factor of 100 in a ten to fifteen year period.\n\nConvergence, a mega electricity sector of power, transport and agriculture\n\nWhat is happening is a really fascinating piece of convergence. Historically the transport sector, which used oil to produce petrol and diesel, and the energy sector, which used coal and natural gas to produce electricity were completely separate. This is changing. The transport sector is being electrified. Cars have batteries which can be charged using electricity. Renewables generate electricity directly from the wind or the sun and are increasingly using batteries to help manage their intermittent nature. The more people buy electric cars the larger the battery market gets. This, in turn drives down the cost of batteries for energy storage for the electricity sector. The more batteries there are for the electricity sector the cheaper batteries will be for cars. Both sectors reinforce each other.\n\nVertical farms link the agriculture sector to the new transport and power sector. Cheap batteries and renewables make vertical farming cheaper. This expands the market for vertical farming which, in turn, create more demand for renewables and batteries, which makes those costs lower for vertical farming. Round and round it goes.\n\nAll three sectors, representing about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions, are starting to converge. This is exciting. The question is whether it will converge fast enough to meet the 1.5 degrees target set at COP26 in 2021.",

For a short while environmental campaigners sought to persuade governments to invest in renewables for national security reasons. Reliance on Russian or Middle East oil and gas makes it more likely that Europe and America will find itself in perpetual conflict with those parts of the world.\n\nThe US military is very concerned about the impacts of climate change on global security and has also sought to develop solar, wind, geothermal and wave energy projects as a way of enhancing the self-sufficiency of its military bases. It has even gone as far as developing naval vessels that can run on biofuels. But at the end of the day, national security has not been a driver for the adoption of renewables. There are too many incumbents in the national security sector who have no desire to share a declining amount of tax payer funds with renewable energy projects.\n\nNo, the main driver is economics. Solar power is already having a significant impact on electricity generation and supply markets, despite having a relatively low overall market share. The problem for coal, gas and nuclear power is that solar is too cheap and they are increasingly unable to compete.\n\nBut how can solar power, which is supposed to be too expensive and needs to be subsidised be too cheap? For this we need a short and highly simplified explanation about how most electricity markets work.\n\nHow electricity markets work\n\nIn any electricity market, which can include a collection of countries, as with much of Europe, a country or a region, there is a mix of electricity generation technologies. At the very base of electricity generation are a group of power stations that generate power for most, if not all, of the day, most days of the year. This is the \"base load\" of power. These power stations generally don't like being switched off, as it can be expensive and time consuming to do so, and are consequently not very flexible. These power stations are also generally the cheapest form of electricity generation and typically comprise of coal power, old nuclear power (which was massively subsidised), large hydropower and some gas fired power stations.\n\nIf more electricity is needed, as demand is high, more flexible power stations are switched on. These may be gas power stations, pumped hydro and, as a last resort, once everything else has been switched on, back up diesel generators. These more flexible electricity producers typically only operate for a few hours per day due to physical issues (like pumped hydro which is reliant on its available water reservoir) or due to costs (like diesel which is expensive and the engines are expensive to maintain making the cost of electricity very high). This gradual increase in the cost of electricity is referred to as the \"merit order\" - which will be referred to in the quote later in this article.\n\nThe spot price of electricity at any moment in the day is based on the cost of the most expensive form of electricity being generated at that time of the day. So if you are in the middle of the day and everybody wants to use electricity - demand is high- your most expensive electricity will be switched on - resulting in a high electricity price that will be paid to all of the electricity suppliers - ranging from the very cheap coal plants to the more expensive diesel generator. This means that the bulk of the profits that are made by coal, nuclear and gas power stations come from the daily peak of demand.\n\nRenewables, such as wind, hydro and solar power, have a key characteristic. One that is very different from conventional power sources: they have no fuel costs and generally have very low maintenance costs. This means that if there is sun or wind the price of electricity will always be cheaper than from all of the conventional power sources, which have to pay for fuel and maintenance costs. This cost is referred to as the \"marginal cost\" and renewables have very low marginal costs compared to conventional power.\n\nSo you are probably now beginning to understand the problem solar poses for the conventional power sector. The bulk of profit for the conventional power sector comes during the peak daylight hours. Solar power produces its peak output of energy at exactly the same time as demand surges. And solar can always undercut conventional power as it has a lower marginal cost. As a result, the more solar that is connected to the grid the more it will eat into the profits of conventional power stations, and at some point it will no longer be economically viable for conventional power stations to operate.\n\nIndustrial consumers are happy, as their peak prices of electricity will drop, thanks to solar, but the main electricity utilities who own conventional power plants are very unhappy. Most solar farms are not owned by electricity utilities, but rather by pension funds and insurance companies, who like the stable revenue streams generated by solar projects and are happy to accept lower rates of return than electricity utilities.\n\nReneweconomy.com.au had a good article in March 2012 which highlighted this issue very well:\n\nThe graph shows a brief leap to EUR 65/MWh around 9am, before the impact of solar PV kicks in. The midday peak is erased entirely and there is only a smaller peak in the evening. The huge bite out of day-prices is also a bite out of earnings and profits for fossil fuel generators. Note that the average peak price in the second graph is barely higher than the baseload price.\n\nDeutsche Bank solar analyst Vishal Shah noted in a report last month that EPEX data demonstrated that solar PV was cutting peak electricity prices by up to 40 per cent; a situation that utilities in Germany and elsewhere in Europe were finding intolerable. \"With Germany adopting a drastic cut, we expect major utilities in other European countries to push for similar cuts as well,\" Shah noted.\n\nAnalysts elsewhere said one quarter of Germany's gas-fired capacity may be closed, because of the impact of surging solar and wind capacity. Enel, the biggest utility in Italy, which had the most solar PV installed in 2011, highlighted its exposure to reduced peaking prices when it reported a EUR 5/MWh fall in average wholesale prices that would translate into a one-third slump in earnings from the generation division.\n\nWind power also has an impact on wholesale electricity prices but because it is generally windier during the winter months and later on in the day and at night it has not caused as much disruption to conventional suppliers as has solar.\n\nThe second problem caused by solar is the difference between retail prices of electricity and wholesale prices of electricity. The retail price of electricity is what normal households and small businesses pay for their electricity. This is typically significantly higher than the wholesale price of electricity, which is the spot market price. Many very large users of electricity can buy electricity at the wholesale price, or slightly higher. It is cheaper for electricity utilities to provide large amounts of electricity to a few big customers than small amounts of electricity to a large number of customers, so it makes sense that there is a price differential. But it is also true that retail customers are more lucrative, as a whole, than big customers who are able to negotiate better rates.\n\nAs more and more households put solar PV on their roof they will no longer have to pay electricity utilities for electricity usage during the day as the the solar panels will be generate enough electricity for their own consumption. As a result, there will be fewer retail customers which will mean that the cost of providing electricity (costs include building, maintaining and operating the grid and providing balancing services) to retail customers will increase. These costs will be borne by a smaller population, those who have not made the switch to solar. In turn, as the retail price of electricity increases, it will provide a greater incentive for more people to switch to solar. If this continues for a few cycles, you can understand why electricity utilities are in a quandary about domestic PV on roofs: it will start to eat into their higher profit business.\n\nThe price of solar PV has dropped remarkably over the past few years. Given the fact that the raw material for solar is silicon (basically sand) for making both the modules and the glass frames, improved manufacturing techniques should see both decreases in costs and improvements in efficiency - which will make solar even cheaper. At a certain moment in time it will become economically viable in many countries without any form of subsidy, (capacity is already being built in countries like Spain without any subsidies). But before that even happens the impact that it will have on the conventional electricity market will be significant.\n\nSo who will be the losers in the solar revolution?\n\nIt takes 3-7 years for conventional power stations to get planning permission and then be built. Solar projects are much faster from a planning perspective and because of their modular nature can be built faster as well. Does it make sense for a major electricity utility to plan for the construction of a new coal, nuclear or gas power station that could very well be more expensive than solar power by the time that it comes on stream? Certainly after 7 years of operation (14 years from now) solar will be cheaper than coal, nuclear and gas. Since solar power will always have a lower marginal cost of power than conventional power, even if it was theoretically possible to compete on price conventionally generated electricity would only be used after the local electricity market had used up all of the available solar power.\n\nAs a result, any new conventional power station that is at the beginning of the planning stage today is likely to be economically unviable within a few years of starting operations. While it might take a while for this new reality to sink in, it does mean that companies that produce large electricity generators and all the ancillary equipment to make a nuclear, coal or gas power station have a finite life. It also means that companies that own and operate conventional power stations have a finite life.\n\nThis is bad news if you are shareholder in a company like GE or in an electricity utility in a country that has reasonable solar irradiation levels. It is also bad news if you are a natural gas company or a coal company.\n\nOver the medium term oil companies will be affected as well. Electric vehicles are almost perfect companions to solar power. Cars are mainly used to commute at the beginning and end of the day - rush hour. For the bulk of the day they are parked, doing nothing. During this down time they could easily recharge their batteries using solar power during the day. The result; vehicles that are very cheap to run. This is bad news if you are a company that produces and sells oil.\n\nThis revolution will take place over a ten-year period. More coal and gas power plants will be built in the meantime. The number of conventional cars on the road in developing countries will continue to expand at a rapid pace. Incumbents in established markets will continue to innovate and will fight back using their considerable political influence over governments.\n\nBut like a game of musical chairs, we all know that the music will stop at some point.\n\nWhere do you want to be left standing?\n\nEstablishing A Price Floor For Energy",

Which brings us to the Great Irish Famine of 1845 and 1852 when over one million people died and another million emigrated from Ireland, causing the population to fall by 20-25%.\n\nThe Great Famine\n\nFirstly, it is important to state that during the entire period of the Great Famine between 1845 and 1852 Ireland should not have run out of food. In fact, Ireland was a net exporter of food throughout the period. Had the food been kept in the country and the land been used to adequately feed its population, no famine would have occurred. As it is today, Ireland was then blessed with great soils and weather for growing food.\n\nSo what was going on? Some background history is important: Ireland had long been controlled by the English monarch. From 1607 onwards Catholics had been banned from holding public office, or serving in the army. In 1641 there had been an Irish Rebellion. The English put this down and financiers called \"Adventurers\" had loaned Parliament to pay for this. Under the 1642 Adventurers Act, the major Catholic landholders in Ireland had their lands confiscated, which was then granted to the Adventurers to either sell off or hold.\n\nOver the next 150 years further anti Catholic and Irish legislation was enacted and sometimes repealed. This included exclusions from voting, a ban on intermarriage with Protestants, exclusion from legal professions and judiciary, a ban on foreign education, a ban on conversion from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism, a ban on Catholics inheriting Protestant land, a ban on Catholics teaching, etc. Many of these laws were not widely observed and some were temporary. What was clear, however, was a long term policy of discrimination against Irish Catholics.\n\nIn 1829 the Catholic Relief Act was enacted, which removed most of the remaining restrictions on Roman Catholics in the United Kingdom. Ireland, which had joined the United Kingdom in the Act of Union in 1801, was the main beneficiary of this. For Catholics, who made up 80% of the Irish population, however, this was in many cases too late.\n\nMost of the land in Ireland was now under the control of English and Anglo-Irish Protestant families. Some of the estates were huge and importantly for our story here, many of the landlords lived in England and were absentee landlords. They relied on land agents, called middlemen, to collect their rents from tenant farmers and then send the money back to England.\n\nMiddlemen leased the land from landlords on long term contracts and then sublet the land in to smaller and smaller parcels of land under a structure called \"conacre (corn- acre)\". Conacre was an 11 month land lease, which meant that there was sufficient time to sow and harvest a crop but did not create any long term legal rights between the tenant and the landlord, rather like a short term property let today. The rent was paid in cash, labour or part of the crop. Due to the short term nature of the relationship, the tenant had little incentive to improve the land and the landlord could switch tenants and activities - such as raising sheep or cattle instead - at will.\n\nThe potato had originally been introduced as a garden crop and by 1815 it had become the staple all year round crop for farmers. Potatoes had many advantages - they generated a significant amount of calories per acre, could be grown easily, even in poor soils, and could be stored well. As more farmland in Ireland was used to raise cattle and sheep for export, conacre farmers relied increasingly on potatoes as their main diet. The high density of potato farming made the crop highly susceptible to disease and when phytophthora infestans , potato blight, arrived in 1845 it spread rapidly. About 1/3 to 1/2 of all potato crops were destroyed. In 1846 3/4 of the harvest was lost. In 1847 there were few seed potatoes available and so the yield was poor again. In 1848 yields were only 2/3 of normal.\n\nTo help alleviate the problem, the British government belatedly decreed that relief should come from the landowners. To stop paying relief the landowners, in turn, evicted farmers off their land, resulting in a mass of newly landless AND destitute farmers. Many then emigrated to England, Scotland, the US, Canada and Australia. Good numbers are hard to establish, but by the mid 1850s almost 2 million Irish had left their homeland.\n\nThe Great Irish Famine had complicated origins and much of the data about what actually happened and to how many people was either never recorded or lost. But certain aspects do stand out from this simplified history:\n\n- a system of absentee landlords meant that there was no social contract between the landlords and their tenants resulting in attitudes to the poor and destitute that were indifferent at best, inhumane at worst;\n\na system of absentee landlords meant that there was no social contract between the landlords and their tenants resulting in attitudes to the poor and destitute that were indifferent at best, inhumane at worst;\n\n- the country should have been in a position to feed itself;\n\nthe country should have been in a position to feed itself;\n\n- food was exported throughout the period;\n\nfood was exported throughout the period;\n\n- over a million Irish died;\n\nover a million Irish died;\n\n- over a million Irish had no choice but to emigrate.\n\nover a million Irish had no choice but to emigrate.\n\nWhich brings us back to the present and the land grabs that are taking place all over the world.\n\nModern land grabs\n\nThe Oakland Institute and LandPortal.info, through their Land Matrix, database are two organisations that have started to document the huge land acquisitions and leases that are taking place. They include details of deals such as Iowa based AgriSol Energy's intended plan to lease 800,000 acres in Tanzania during which 160,000 long term residents were to be evicted as part of this process. The table below, from Land Matrix, shows the main participating investor countries, by number of deals and by hectares of land acquired or leased. In most cases the investors are private and include Ivy League university endowments, hedge funds to pension funds. As a result, your money may be involved in these transactions.\n\nThe Oakland Institute says that these policies will create additional food insecurity, take away land and water from local populations and transform valuable grazing land, natural forests and food producing fields into plantations for agrofuels and trees for export. Land Matrix has a 64 page report on the subject. Some of its key findings are:\n\nAfrica is the most targeted region, with Sudan, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, Zambia and the DR Congo as the most popular;\n\n- 66% of deals are in countries with high levels of hunger;\n\n66% of deals are in countries with high levels of hunger;\n\n- Most projects are export orientated;\n\nMost projects are export orientated;\n\n- Investors are competing for land with local farming communities;\n\nInvestors are competing for land with local farming communities;\n\n- Forested areas are highly affected;\n\nForested areas are highly affected;\n\n- Investment is from wealthier food importing countries;\n\nInvestment is from wealthier food importing countries;\n\n- Rush for land is being driven by long term food trends;\n\nRush for land is being driven by long term food trends;\n\n- Investors are acquiring water rights;\n\nInvestors are acquiring water rights;\n\n- Governments are selling land that is used by small holders;\n\nGovernments are selling land that is used by small holders;\n\n- There is very little evidence of benefits from employment generation.\n\nThere is very little evidence of benefits from employment generation.\n\nSo the question is whether there is a possible parallel with what was going on in Ireland in the 1800s and what is going on around the world now with respects to land grabs.\n\nAre there parallels with the Great Famine?\n\nThere are no perfect parallels in history. However, there are a number of overlaps that are concerning:\n\nAbsentee landlords: Absentee landlords in Ireland meant that there was no social contract between the landlord and the tenant. This social contract is important, because if things go wrong and there is no social contract landlords walk, leaving poor tenant farmers to deal with the issues themselves. Having landlords living thousands of miles away cannot be conducive to having a strong social contract. Investors are investing to make a good return on their invested cash, not to promote general social well being.\n\n- Power imbalance between the host country and the investing country. Ireland had very weak political governance. The majority population, the Roman Catholics, had faced centuries of discrimination resulting in low levels of political participation, low levels of education and low levels of land ownership. Many of the host countries for modern investors, such as Ethiopia, Sudan and DR Congo are equally weak. Local politicians are more likely to benefit personally from these transactions, compared to the populations that they are supposed to represent.\n\nPower imbalance between the host country and the investing country.

Ireland's land became increasingly export orientated, which did little to benefit the local population.

What will happen to domestic food consumption if more of their land is turned over to the export of crops, which may not even be used for human consumption - such as palm oil?\n\nExport focus on the food.

Will the investor nations accept tens or hundreds of millions of immigrants?\n\nHistory Future Now remains on the fence about these new land grabs. So far, there does not appear to be widespread major problems and perhaps there never will be. Unfortunately, the scale of these acquisitions suggests that at some point in time in one of these countries a chain of events not to dissimilar to the Great Famine will occur.\n\nWith the numbers of people involved, the consequences could make the Great Irish Famine look like a minor event.\n\nIt is by understanding our history that we can best understand the present. By understanding the present we are able to understand how our societies will develop in the future.\n\nDealing With The Consequences Of Climate Chance Inaction: The Impact Of Food",

Much of this feels familiar to a historian. So is China really an up-and-coming colonial power, or is this something completely new?\n\nHistory Future Now first looks back in time for some other examples of colonialism, ranging from the beginnings of recorded history up to the present day.\n\nGreeks, city states, Marseilles, Carthage.\n\nOnce reasonably risk free navigation and ship building techniques had been established in the Mediterranean, its main innovators used their new technology to trade and eventually set up colonies all the way to the Straights of Gibraltar and the Atlantic Ocean. The Phoenicians, who provided us with the basis of our phonetic alphabet, were extremely competent mariners and many left their base on the eastern Mediterranean around modern day Lebanon in the 1200s BC to found port cities, one of which would become even more famous than their mother city: Carthage. The Greeks also expanded in the 800s-700s BC, spreading their city state model of political organisation around the Aegean and Black Seas all over Italy, Sicily and into southern France and eastern Spain.\n\nThe founding of these colonies appears to have been done by family groups who set up villages on the coast, to provide easy sea access, and with the reasonable acquiescence of local tribes (at least until the villages turned into populous cities). A primary driver appears to have been population growth: emigration helped keep numbers at home at a manageable level. While the city states did appear to cooperate together and support their mother city, they were independent entities and were not governed from a distance.\n\nRoman colonies\n\nUnlike the Greek and Phoenician/Carthaginian city states, the Romans were not great sailors for most of their history, and Roman colonies were mainly contiguous to Roman occupied lands. By the end of the Roman Republic, reforms to the way the Roman military was recruited meant that land was frequently granted to retiring soldiers. With limited public land available at home, veteran soldiers were granted land in newly won territories and provinces. This served a dual purpose of expanding Roman influence & culture and providing a core of Roman reserves to call upon if the newly conquered populations rose up in rebellion.\n\nUnlike Greek colonies, who moved in family units, this form of colonisation was mainly of single men who eventually married local women, passing on Roman citizenship to their offspring. Many of these colonies were actively resented by the local population and in the 1st Century BC uprisings in Asia Minor (Turkey) resulted in the coordinated massacre of Roman settlers.\n\nInverse Roman colonisation\n\nFrom the 300s onwards the Roman Empire stopped expanding and consolidated its borders. Border tribes became increasingly Romanised and wanted to move into the Empire. This desire to move into a highly prosperous region was enhanced as waves of new tribes - such as the Huns - pushed whole nations against the borders of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Romans had good systems to deal with large numbers of immigrants. The young and able were frequently mustered into joining the army, rather like the Union States does today with its own immigrants. Family groups were sometimes separated and the population dispersed throughout the empire. In 376AD this system abruptly broke down when what should have been a regular border crossing turned into a riot. The Romans had abused their position, sold many of immigrants into slavery and stripped them of their wealth. Rising up in arms, a wave of Visigoths rolled into the Empire, unchecked.\n\nOver time, this became the norm, with successive Germanic nation groups settling in France, Spain and North Africa. These nations eventually stopped paying taxes to the Roman central government and the Roman Empire in the west withered away, finally ending when the Germanic ruler of Italy usurped the young Emperor Romulus Augustus in 474AD and sent the imperial regalia to the Eastern Roman Emperor in Constantinople. Unlike Greek and Roman colonies, this form of colonisation was unplanned and large numbers of people simply overwhelmed the local Roman populations.\n\nSpanish New World colonies\n\nBy 1492, the Spanish Christian kingdoms of Castille and Aragon were masters of the art of warfare. They were the descendants of the German tribes that had reverse colonised Roman Closer and Further Hispania and had merged with the local populations. The successful Arab invasions of North Africa and Spain prior to 720 AD had pushed these Christian groups to the north and west of the peninsula. A love of church bells, a dual use technology whose military bi-product was cannon and guns, helped Christians fight back and on the 2nd January 1492 Granada, in the southern Arab kingdom of Andalusia, fell to their most Catholic Majesties Isabella of Castilla and Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\nWhen the Italian Christopher Colombus approached them for funds for his geographically challenged voyage to China and thus bypass the Islamic monopoly of trade following the fall of Constantinople in 1453 they accepted.\n\nSpanish colonisation was the first time in over 20,000 years that Eurasian germs had successfully been able to adapt to the densely populated and warm climes of the Caribbean, Central and South America. They did so with gusto and within 50 years up to 90% of the original inhabitants of the New World had been wiped out by disease.\n\nDisease and military technology superiority had de-stabilised the local ruling elites giving a small number of Spaniards the ability to dominate their areas. Like Roman colonisation, Spanish colonisation was centrally managed, albeit at a distance, and led by former soldiers who intermarried with the locals. But the populations that they inherited had been decimated. This required them to bring in new labour - African slaves - to do the work that they wanted doing. This form of involuntary African colonisation was particularly successful in the Caribbean islands where they dominated ethnically.\n\nEnglish colonies in America\n\nEarly English colonists were refugees. First came the Puritans from eastern England with their unpopular Protestant views. Like the Greek colonies, these colonists came in large family groups and tended to stick to the coast, providing access to England and new colonial recruits. Also like the Greek colonies, the lands that they encountered were considerably less populated than from whence they had come, thanks to Eurasian disease brought over one hundred years earlier by the Spanish. Like the Inverse Roman Colonisation of German tribes in the 300-500s, the numbers of colonists eventually overwhelmed the local population wiping out most of the indigenous people and their cultures.\n\nThe second wave of High Church of England aristocrats, accompanied by single indentured servants, from the southern part of England was different. They settled in hotter, less appealing climes but soon discovered that their lands were ideal for many of the crops that were appealing to Europeans: tobacco and sugar. Unlike the northern settlements, which were family orientated and more egalitarian, the southern colonists continued their aristocratic tendencies with larger estates and a larger distribution between rich and poor. Favourable winds provided a wind powered merchant navy a profitable triangle of trade which enabled English manufactured trinkets to be sold to coastal Africans, where they then purchased captured Africans which they then sold to Americans and then purchased tobacco, sugar and eventually cotton back to the English.\n\nThe third wave of Quakers, and their Germanic kinsmen, was similar to the first wave and also moved relatively far north. The fourth wave came from the borderlands of Wales, Ireland and Scotland and promptly moved to the western borderlands in America, bringing their distinctive culture with them. These groups also benefited from a military superiority over native American tribes and these colonists overwhelmed the local indigenous populations.\n\nTrading colonies\n\nThe Dutch city states kicked off a new form of colonisation, which was initially similar to the Phoenician trading outpost. These activities were joint ventures between the state and private investors, who used the innovation of the joint stock ownership company to share the costs, risks and income associated with trading missions. The Dutch were superb ship builders and used highly mechanised processes powered by wind mills to produce large numbers of low cost well built ships. These merchant ships of the VOC were big enough to carry a good cargo, well armed enough to fight off any pirates and fast enough to out run ships sent to intercept them in large numbers.\n\nThey used these ships to do what Christopher Colombus had initially signed up Isabella and Ferdinand to do - cut out the Islamic middleman and trade directly with east Asia and China, bringing back large volumes of spices and silks to Europe at a huge profit. Amsterdam is testament to the wealth that was generated during that period.\n\nThis was not really colonisation as we have seen previously. There were no family groups involved and no real emigration of single men to a new location. Britain's second empire, after the loss of the American colonies in 1783, was a similar trading empire.\n\nBut colonisation did eventually happen. At times of dispute between local rulers and Dutch and English traders (in India) force of arms, rather than diplomacy was used. Once enough local rulers had been sufficiently chastened a power vacuum emerged which was eventually filled by Dutch and British government officials. Compared to emigration to America, emigration to Africa and Asia was tiny. Once they ended their colonial rule the influence of the English and Dutch on the native peoples was quickly eroded, with the significant exception of the use of the English language and common law.\n\nMe- too- colonialism\n\nNo account of colonialism is complete without mentioning the late-to-the-game colonialism of Germany, Italy and Japan, which ultimately led to the Second World War.\n\nGermany, blocked to the west, had some half hearted African colonial attempts but it was Nazi Germany that decided to push east into Poland and Russia to achieve living space for his people. Unlike the English and Spanish colonies, in America, however, Russia had a large population, a strong political leadership, equal access and production of military technologies and similar diseases. Turning your equals into colonies is difficult.\n\nItaly headed south, with an attempt to recreate a Mediterranean empire. Like Germany, its efforts were largely repelled, despite superior access to military technologies. Japan also headed south and west. China proved a quagmire, despite its initially weak political leadership. US military supplies and Communist leadership, however, made its efforts there unsuccessful and gradual attrition due to unequal military capabilities with the US made it lose its island empire and then its homeland.\n\nSo is China colonising Africa?\n\nChina does not appear to want to use Africa as a place to send its expanding population. While China's population is still growing due to demographic momentum, its widely practiced one child policy will result in an eventual peak and then decline of its population.\n\nChina wants Africa's resources. It is willing to lock in higher than market prices today in the anticipation that demand for raw materials will go up over the next five to ten years. As part of that process it is willing to build infrastructure in Africa to get to the resources. Interestingly, much of the work is done by Chinese workers who live in compounds, though perhaps not as much as widely reported.\n\nAs a result China seems to be following a path similar to that of the Dutch and English trading empires with relatively small numbers of Chinese responsible for extracting resources and then shipping them back to China for processing into value added products.\n\nAt some point, however, Chinese interests in a particular country will become sufficiently large that it will need to have a political say in the economy in order to protect its investment. In the event of armed conflict between locals and its Chinese workers it will be forced to defend its nationals.\n\nAs the Dutch and English discovered, once you start to get involved politically and militarily to defend economic interests, it is a short hop and a skip to full blown colonisation.\n\nChina is on that path, whether it wants to be or not.\n\nRome Vs.

It even includes an action list of what we need to do to escape from this Faustian bargain.\n\nWhile there is never a real beginning to a story in history - there is always a possible prequel - we first need to go back to the traumatic events of 1917 and then look forward all the way to 2013 and beyond.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Communism\n\nThe rise of Communism came about, like many things in history, as a result of a long series of unintended consequences.\n\nIn 1917 the German government arranged for a special sealed train to take Vladimir Lenin from his exile in Switzerland, via Germany, Sweden and Finland to Russia in return for a promise to pull Russia out of the war once the Tsar had been toppled. Lenin won the revolution, kept his side of the bargain, and Russia pulled out of the Great War, allowing Germany to focus her war efforts on the Western Front. Despite the rhetoric, relations between Russia and Germany remained good all the way up to Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. As German tanks crossed the border into the Ukraine, Soviet freight trains, carrying raw materials for German factories, crossed the border in the other direction. The Allies, who generally loathed and feared Communism, found themselves supporting Stalin for the next four years, until the end of the Second World War ushered in the Cold War.\n\nThe Second World War created a huge upheaval in the global balance of power. Western Europe, which had been the dominant force in the globe, with colonial territories everywhere, shriveled economically, politically and militarily. Britain lost Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India, plus her African territories. France and Italy also retrenched. The United States, which had been an isolationist power since the days of President Jefferson, found itself in the lucky position of being the only major country left undamaged in the West. Not only financially secure but with an economy that had been supercharged by the war, and with a military-industrial complex that rapidly filled in the vacuum created by the loss of Western European hegemony. The death of millions of men and the general destruction of European countries' infrastructure led to a post-war continuation of mobilisation of economies, with levels of government intervention and control which would have been unthinkable prior to 1939. This general move towards a semi-social state was only outdone by the Soviet Union, whose command and control economy enabled it to produce war materiel in enormous quantities, to the detriment of its overall economy.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1991 the world became bi-polar with the West, aligned around the United States, facing off against the Eastern block, aligned around the Soviet Union. The Third World, those that were officially unaligned in this struggle, was either ignored or became the hosts to proxy battles between the two great superpowers. But by 1989 tensions within the Soviet Union meant that its dominance over its satellite states ended. Gorbachev pulled out of the long war in Afghanistan in March of that year. By November most of the former Soviet block had gone their own way, with new independent leaders in Poland, Hungary and Romania. The Berlin Wall fell which led to the eventual reunification of most of Germany. The Soviet Union fractured irrevocably and on Christmas Day 1991 the Soviet flag was pulled down for the last time over the Kremlin.\n\nWhy did Communism Fail and Free Market Capitalism succeed? The search for a reason.\n\nThe success of the US over its former wartime ally then Cold War enemy, the Soviet Union, seems inevitable in hindsight: the Soviet Union, for all its posturing and arsenal of weapons was not as powerful as it had originally appeared.\n\nThe problem with the US victory over Communism, however, was that it reinforced a set of American myths. This dillusion meant that the US, and by proxy the West, learned the wrong lessons about why they had been victorious. An inevitable search began to contrast the differences between the Soviet and Western system. There was a neat logic: if the Soviet Union did one thing and the US the opposite then, since the US had won, the US way of doing things had to be superior.\n\nThe American Communist party had argued with Stalin in the 1920s that America was \"exceptional\" in the history of the world and fell outside Marx's laws of history \"thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity and absence of rigid class distinctions\".\n\nThis view reinforced the concept of \"American exceptionalism\" that had existed since Alexis de Tocquville, the famous on-the-ground observer of the American Revolution, wrote in his 1840 book 'Democracy in America' that 'The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional and it may be believed that no other democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one.'\n\nIndeed, the United States of America has been exceptionally lucky throughout history. At the time of the American Revolution the 13 British colonies were just part of a collection of European settlements in North America. Spain, with its possessions in the south, and France, to the west, claimed jurisidiction over the bulk of North and Central America.\n\nThen, out of the blue, Napoleon Bonapart's shortage of cash for his European wars led him to sell France's continental territory of Louisiana to President Jefferson in 1803. This fortuitous acquisition doubled the size of the US. Later territorial conquests over Spanish Mexico, in the run up to the US Civil War, expanded the available land. The post Civil War incorporation of Territories in the mid-West into the United States continued to ensure that US citizens had the one thing that most other people across the world lacked. American people owned huge quantities of virgin land and natural resources for expansion. While Old World governments lived cheek by jowl alongside rivals countries with whom relationships veered, the US government and its people had an almost free hand across the continent.\n\nUnfettered access to land and resources, and freedom helped to make America 'exceptional'. Yet by the late 1890s the Trusts, established by Rockefeller, Morgan and Carnegie, had started to use this unfettered freedom to establish powerful business monopolies that were for the benefit of the few not the many. These powers were used to abuse the democratic system, in the 1896 US presidential election William McKinley was effectively bought. For the next five years President McKinley protected his paymasters, until he was assassinated and his Vice President, the fiery, progressive, Theodore Roosevelt became President. President Roosevelt instigated reforms that bust the trusts and set up a governing ideology that was adopted by both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAnd yet the mythology of the great frontier, a place where citizens were in charge of their own destiny and hard work was all that was needed to create wealth and prosperity, continued. By the late 1920s the US was on a roll. Low interest rates, set by the newly created Federal Reserve Bank, enabled a huge speculative bubble to emerge in the stock market and in property.\n\nEverybody felt wealthy. A dour Austrian economist, Frederik Hayek, warned about the possible impact of lax monetary policy in late 1929. A few weeks later the 1929 Wall Street crash started, which left the US in deep economic turmoil, until a flood of government expenditure, thanks to the Second World War, pulled the US out of the Great Depression.\n\nThe post war US experience was radically different to that of the citizens of Europe. For Europeans, life was harsh. Government became key to survival. It helped to rebuild destroyed roads, bridges and infrastructure. It looked after the widowed, the wounded and the orphaned. It set up institutions like the European Coal and Steel Community in 1950 to ensure that interdependence among leading European nations would make war between Europeans impossible in the future.\n\nIn contrast, for Americans the post war period was a boom time.\n\nGovernment intervention in the economy was still many times larger than it had been prior to the Second World War. The US continued to maintain a large military presence - which President Eisenhower warned about as the military-industrial complex. But the private sector boomed as well, with US firms taking advantage of the destruction of European businesses to expand into markets that had hereto been closed to them. Expansion overseas was also matched by an expansion of infrastructure, such as the highway system, in the US itself.\n\nBy the 1970s Europe had started to recover from the Second World War. European and Japanese businesses, which had been wiped out by the war, started to compete again on the international stage. The US euphoria of the 1960s, culminating in the July 1969 landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, was replaced by the general feeling of malaise of the 1970s. President Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, replaced by President Ford and then the do-gooding, peanut farming, Jimmy Carter, who left America humiliated over the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981.\n\nIn January 1981 President Reagan promised a new dawn for America. Handsome and articulate, he embodied the western myth of the great frontiersman wherein all people had to do was work hard to get ahead in life. Reagan's view that government was the problem, not the solution, resonated with the people. Despite this avowal Reagan presided over a massive increase in government expenditure to fund a military build up against the Soviet Union, now dubbed the \"Evil Empire\".\n\nAnd so when the Soviet Union collapsed on Christmas Day 1991, the lesson that everybody learned was that big government socialism and communism had failed. Communists had literally pulled down the flag over the Kremlin. In contrast, the lesson that free, open, markets had won was obvious to all.\n\n1992 ushered in a new form of global dominance. America became a hyper power. It was socially, culturally, economically and militarily the most powerful country in the world. More powerful than any country had been in the history of mankind.\n\nSocialist leaning political parties across Europe and the Democratic Party in the US found themselves on the back foot. To compete against this new truth, that the free market was victorious, they rapidly changed their own policies. In the US, Reagan's apprentice, Bush, lost out against Clinton with his 'third way' political views. In the UK, Thatcher's successor, Major, lost out against Blair who some consider to be Thatcher's natural heir despite his different part allegiance. Blair's Britain mimicked many of Clinton's policies. Free market ideology ruled, unchallenged.\n\nAnd yet, a mere 21 years later, in 2013, the West appears weaker than at any time since the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nSuccess led to learning the wrong lesson\n\nThe problem for the West in its victory over Communism was that the lesson that it learned was faulty. The belief that free, open, markets are good and that communism was bad was only partially true, some of the time. And as with most things in life, timing is everything.\n\nAfter the Second World War, US companies were able to expand into territories that had previously been dominated by European businesses and governments. For them free markets were fantastic: they had products, goods and services that people wanted and all of their competitors had literally been blown to pieces.\n\nJapan quickly realised that this free-for-all was all very well for US companies but was terrible for Japanese companies who were struggling to compete in their home market, let alone trying to expand overseas. Japan consequently slapped on trade tariffs, and legislated local content and ownership rules, much to the chagrin of US companies. Under the resultant protectionist shield Japanese companies developed innovative products for their home market and by the 1980s were able to sell their better products at lower prices to the Americans and to Europeans.\n\nThe 1990s ushered in a repeat of the US's experience after the Second World War. The collapse of the Soviet Union not only opened up the entire Soviet block to Western companies, but also gave access to the rest of the hereto ignored Third World of non-aligned countries and former colonial territories.\n\nUS and European consultants descended on credulous government bureaucrats all over the world and persuaded them to open up their countries and liberalise as fast as possible through \"shock therapy\" and mass privatisations. Trade barriers came down and huge state owned companies were snapped up by local kleptocrats, people who happened to have the right jobs at the right time. By 1994 Coca Cola and McDonalds outlets could be found over most of the former Soviet Union and beyond, symbols of American culture and business prowess.\n\nThroughout most of the 1990s the West experienced a peacetime dividend: even the blip of the first Gulf War merely reinforced the West's sense of superiority as US equipped Allied forces obliterated Soviet equipped Iraqi forces. Technology, which had been relatively stagnant since the mid 1960s, seemed to speed up again with the advent of personal computers and mobile phones. The concept of the 'service sector' took root, with financial sector deregulation seemingly able to create huge profits without the sweat and toil of manufacturing and filthy extraction of raw materials.\n\nAnd so by the time President William Jefferson Clinton stepped down on 20th January 2001 the West had gone through a thirty-year epic drama, divided into three acts almost a decade long apiece. The first act, showed the West in decline, a victim of over regulation and big government under Carter, amongst others. The second act was the re-establishment of power of the individual and free markets under Reagan and Thatcher opposed to the tyranny of big government and communism. The third act showed the West taking the prize, with Communism crushed and Western values of freedom and open markets under the centrist governments of Clinton and Blair.\n\nThirty years is a big chunk of a human's lifespan. If you are less than 40 years old today this 30-year period represents almost everything that you know. If you are sixty years old this epic drama represents your entire working life.\n\nBut, what if everything you think you know to be true is actually wrong?\n\nWhat if the lesson about the march of free markets from 1971 to 2001 is the wrong lesson to have learned?\n\nUnfortunately, it was the wrong lesson. The West's rise predated Karl Marx by 400 years and its success had nothing to do with free markets. To explain why we first need to go back even further in time, to 1453.\n\nThe defeat of Constantinople and the rise of Western mercantilism\n\nThe year 1453 has to be a front-runner for the most important date in the history of the world. This year, which represented a defeat for Christendom and a victory for Islam, is the pivot point which turned Western Europe from being at the furthest edge of Eurasia to being at the center of a Western dominated Atlantic Ocean. A center crisscrossed by trading routes between the Americas and Europe which would expand to control Africa, Australasia and Asia itself.\n\nTrade between China and Europe had travelled along the Silk Road since the time of the Romans. Asia had two major, highly portable, commodities that the West desired: silk, produced through a secret process in China, and spices from India and South East Asia. China, in return, wanted only two things: silver and gold.\n\nTo get to Asia Europeans needed to cross through the eastern Mediterranean. By 1450 all of this territory was under Muslim rule. Egypt, Palestine and Syria were under the control of the Malmuks and the Karmanid Empire that ruled south east Turkey. The Ottoman Empire controlled most of western and northern Turkey and the southeastern edge of Europe. Byzantium had shriveled to a rump state around the city of Constantinople, with much of southern Greece also under their control.\n\nNevertheless, the European traders - mainly from Genoa and Venice - continued to trade with Asia, via Muslim middlemen. Mehmed II succeeded his father as sultan of the Ottomans in 1451 and, although only 19, immediately went about preparing to capture Constantinople. He was successful and in May 1453 took over the city. He cut off the Silk Road from the West in the process.\n\nThe next forty years marked a period of extensive period of exploration by European traders who were frantic to find an alternative route to Asia, bypassing the Muslim blockade. The traders and country that controlled this trade would become very wealthy. The Portuguese had already mastered much of the long distance navigation required to find this route: they had been exploring the west coast of Africa in search of gold and slaves.\n\nIn 1455 Pope Nicholas V issued a papal bull in favour of King Alfonso V of Portugal, which gave the Portuguese the legal right to a monopoly of trade in Africa and Asia. All lands that were settled and all peoples discovered were to become the property of the Portuguese. Vasco da Gama found the sea route to India in 1498 and Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas in 1492, prompting another papal bull in 1493 (by the Spanish Pope Alexander VI) granting Spain all lands to the west and south of a pole to pole line 100 leagues west and south of any of the islands of the Azores or the Cape Verde Islands. Since Brazil, as yet undiscovered, jutted out so far to the east it is for this reason that Brazil became a Portuguese colony in an otherwise Spanish continent.\n\nThis process of granting monopolies was to form the core of a new philosophy for dealing with trade and foreign affairs, called mercantilism. It was this mercantilist philosophy that was to fuel the rise of the West.\n\nMercantilism's role in the rise of the West\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution decoupled the link between labour and output it was believed that a country's wealth, and thus its ability to arm itself and project power, was seen as a zero sum game. If one country had wealth it meant that another country did not.\n\nEarly mercantilist philosophy was driven by the empirical experience of traders who saw that if one country, such as Spain and Portugal, had control over the wealth of the Americas, Africa or Asia, they would be wealthier and thus more powerful. This was obvious to any observer at the time. The discovery of a mountain made out of silver in Peru at Potosí resulted in Spain becoming incredibly wealthy. Spain was then able to buy not only luxuries from China, who loved silver above all thing, but also to gain political, religious and economic dominance over Europe.\n\nA driver for Elizabethan England was to find a way to combat an increasingly dominant Spain. Elizabeth and her government adopted similar restrictive trade practices. They established English colonies in North America and licensed private English shipping to harass and steal from Spanish bullion ships as part of that strategy. In 1549 a pamphlet appeared claiming that \"We must always take heed that we buy no more from strangers than we sell them, for so would we impoverish ourselves and enrich them.\"\n\nBy the 1620s writers such as Thomas Mun, who was a director of the East India Company, were expanding the philosophy to recommend that England increase its wealth by frugal domestic consumption, and a reduction of imports by better exploiting England's own natural resources. Furthermore to lower export duties to encourage sales overseas. Later mercantilist writers would add that imports should be restricted if the goods could be sufficiently and suitably supplied at home. If imports were necessary they should be confined to raw materials that could be finished off in England before being re-exported.\n\nJean-Baptise Colbert was the Minster of Finances of France from 1665-1683 for Louis XIV. He brought mercantilist practices to France. Under his ministry there were widespread measures to limit imports and to favour exports. Guilds were established, creating monopolies and thousands of foreign artisans and craftsmen were imported to establish technical learning centres that could produce goods to compete with foreign imports.\n\nBritain also made efforts to protect and control its merchant navy and to make best use of its expanding colonies in North America. The Navigation Acts banned the use of non-British merchant-ships to trade with its colonies and forced its colonies to only produce raw materials for and only to trade with Britain. The diaries of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are filled with complaints about the middlemen that they used to buy manufactured goods from Britain. Goods which would frequently arrive broken or were sold at extortionate prices.\n\nOn the back of these policies one thing was clear: the countries that adopted flexible mercantilist practices, such as Britain and France, became wealthier and more powerful than their neighbours that did not.\n\nAdam Smith, David Ricardo and the switch to Free Trade\n\nThe fundamental problem with mercantilism is that it is only really effective if you use it and your competitors do not. If all countries were to adopt mercantilist practices there would be almost no trade at all. Countries would cease to buy goods from each other and would just buy the occasional raw material that they desperately needed, and nothing else. By the late 1700s this practice was indeed becoming the case, and even loyal colonies were beginning to get frustrated by the fact that they were not allowed to manufacture anything or to develop their own industry. This disaffection, plus the fact that Britain refused to allow the American colonies to expand westwards after the French-Indian Wars, became one of the main drivers for the American Revolution.\n\nAdam Smith was particularly against mercantilism and felt that it was a means by which those who had obtained monopolies could exploit consumers. Which was exactly what they were doing. But it was David Ricardo who managed to identify a plausible alternative to mercantilism that would solve the issue of what to do if everybody was using mercantilist practices.\n\nHe came up with the concept of comparative advantage: if one country (he used Portugal and England in his examples) is comparatively better at producing wine (e.g. higher quality for lower cost) but not as good at producing cloth (e.g. lower quality at higher cost) while another country is better at producing cloth but worse at producing wine then they would both be better off trading than doing it themselves.\n\nAt first glance Ricardian economics makes a great deal of common sense. It also had the advantage that Britain was entering the Industrial Revolution in 1817 when Ricardo, who was one of 17 children, was writing his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. With the backing of this intellectual framework Britain could legitimately tell other countries that they were better off abandoning mercantilism and opening up to free trade.\n\nSo while other countries were clinging to mercantilism, Britain pushed hard for open, free, markets. It was still difficult for other countries to trade with Britain's remaining colonies, but Britain was keen to ensure that everyone else benefited from its modern economic theories: in 1839 Britain started to attack Chinese shipping and ports in the opening salvoes of the First Opium War to forcibly China to open up to free trade.\n\nThe problem for other countries was that as Britain had had the Industrial Revolution first. It was the first country in the history of mankind to fully decouple human labour from production. Historically the size of a country's population was the main determinant of economic success. The more people you had in the workforce the more things you could produce. That is why China had been so wealthy. Coal based steam engines powering huge factories enabled British workers to multiply their productivity so that Britain would become the manufacturing base of the entire world.\n\nRicardian theory, as a result, was only vaguely applicable to Britain's circumstances. Britain could produce nearly ALL manufactured goods at higher quality and lower cost than all other nations. All that Britain needed was raw materials and most of those could be found in its own colonies.\n\nThe American School\n\nWhile Britain was merrily dumping its high quality, low cost, products across the world, devastating the economies of its forced trading partners at the same time, the US was having none of it. Alexander Hamilton, the First US Treasury Secretary, argued that the US could not be truly independent until it became self-sufficient. To ensure that independence happened a rival American School of economic thought was established to counteract the British School advocated by Adam Smith, which lasted, in various guises, all the way to the 1970s.\n\nThe American School had a number of ideas. At its core was the belief that the US government should protect its industry, especially infant industries, from facing competition from abroad. The Morrill Tariff, introduced in 1861, for example, slapped high import duties on British iron, clothing and manufactured exports.\n\nHigh tariff policies lasted until the 1913 Revenue Act allowed for a federal income tax and reduced the need for import tariffs as a means of gaining revenues. The US was also more developed economically by that time and so was better able to compete head to head with British and European manufactured products. Unlike Britain, which had relatively few raw materials and so needed its colonies, the US was well endowed with natural resources and so could produce both raw materials and manufactured goods comparatively cheaper than other nations.\n\nLike Britain, once ready, the US was keen to take advantage of its comparative advantage in everything and to open up the world to the benefits of its free trade. In July 1853 the US Commodore Perry sailed into Edo Bay, Japan, with his squadron of hybrid sailing /side wheel steam frigates. He presented his demands that Japan open up, or else face the destruction wrought on China.\n\nJapan did open up, and in turn developed its own mercantilist policies that enabled it to be militarily powerful enough to invade Korea, China and eventually attack the US navy base in Hawaii in 1941.\n\nA quick recap\n\nWe have covered a lot of ground in this chapter, over 500 years of history, the geopolitical challenges throughout that period and the economic theories that drove change. This background is necessary as we reach our conclusion, and many readers will already know where we are heading.\n\nBut first, a quick recap.\n\nThe dominant Western economic ideology since 19?81 has been that free trade is good, without exception. The \"proof\" that this is true was the \"fact\" that the West won the Cold War, whilst pursuing free trade, and Communist Russia had lost. Further evidence supporting this theory is that for the ten years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, markets liberalised everywhere and the West became richer and more powerful.\n\nHistory Future Now argues, however, that the logic that \"free trade is good because the West won the Cold War as a result of its adherence to free trade\" is circular, and wrong.\n\nInstead, we look at the rise of mercantilism from 1453 which turned trading prowess into political and military might. It shows that the most successful mercantile countries such as Britain, the US and Japan, were advocates of mercantilism until they had industrialised sufficiently to give them a comparative advantage in nearly all economic activities. Once powerful nations had reached this level of development they became keen proponents of free trade, as their businesses were able to crush all opposition.\n\n2001- a pivotal year\n\nLike in 1991, with the fall of the Soviet Union, 2001 was a pivotal year in history.\n\nTwo events occurred that were of note: first was the audacious Islamic attack on the World Trade Center's two towers in September. An act of terrorism which exposed the vulnerability of America's open society and shocked Americas into the realisation that many foreigners really hated America. This one violent act would lead the US and the West down a rabbit warren of costly and distracting wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and lead to general chaos in the Muslim world, stretching from Algeria in the west to Pakistan and Indonesia in the east.\n\nBut it was three months later, on the 11th December that the most important event occurred. After 15 years of negotiations China became a member of the World Trade Organisation.\n\nTo understand why this was such an important event we need to go back forty years, to the early 1970s and the drive for economic and financial deregulation.\n\nHayek, Friedman, von Miese and the push for deregulation.\n\nDuring the late 1800s and early 1900s private companies delivering \"utility\" type services had persuaded the US government to restrict new entrants to compete across a range of sectors including water, electricity, communications and transport. The argument was that these \"public\" services were expensive to provide and so companies providing these services needed regulations to protect their investments: if there was no protection, private companies would not be able to offer customers the best possible service. The financial services sector had also been heavily regulated in the early 1930s to help prevent the occurrence of another Wall Street crash, with the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange act of 1934.\n\nBut by the 1970s economists such as Hayek, Friedman and von Miese began to persuade the US government that many regulations were excessive and were stifling the economy. In many respects this was true: laws and policies that had been enacted to stop abuses of the individual against the common good had been expanded and amended to such a level that their original purpose had been forgotten and all that remained was a morass of regulations that benefited few and stifled legitimate business.\n\nThe first major push for deregulation occurred under the Nixon administration to deregulate rail and truck transportation. President Carter also pushed for deregulation with the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act and two other road and rail acts in 1980. The aim for most of these deregulations was to reduce barriers to entry and to promote more independent players and competitive pricing. Reagan continued with these policies in his first term and also promoted deregulation of the energy and telecommunications sector.\n\nThis bi-partisan push for deregulation of the US economy made a huge amount of sense. It allowed businesses operating in the US market to operate on a more level playing field and to reduced the ability for incumbents to indulge in what they referred to as \"rent - seeking\" activities, a real no-no for free market thinkers from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman.\n\nAnd this is the key point: deregulation and freedom of competition within countries or even a number of countries that all operate on a similar basis is good for incumbents, new entrants and consumers. Competition is on a level playing field under identical labour and environmental laws and with access to the same type of workers at similar salaries.\n\nBut the subsequent form of deregulation, that of the financial sector, was different to all previous forms of deregulation and had global implications.\n\nFinancial services deregulation\n\nIn October 1986 a new wave of deregulation took place in the financial services sector in the United Kingdom, dubbed the \"Big Bang\". The rationale behind Big Bang was that London's place as a financial center had been undermined by competition from New York. The London banking sector was deemed as over-regulated and dominated by a cosy wine-at-lunch, old-school-tie network of public school boys. Which was true.\n\nOne of the reasons for the 1929 Wall Street crash was that banks had used deposits from retail customers to speculate on the stock market. A solution to this was the Glass-Steagall Act of 1932 which forcibly separated retail banks (where individuals deposited their money) from speculative investment banks.\n\nThere was no equivalent Glass-Steagall Act in the UK and merchant banks (as investment banks were called) remained as partnerships, with partners in the banks being personally liable for any of the losses incurred by their firms. This reduced UK merchant bank's appetites to do anything that would risk wiping out their partners financially.\n\nWhat was unforeseen by Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer under Thatcher, was that US financial institutions would be able to use London as a springboard to get round Glass-Steagall, enabling a new merger of retail and investment banks. By 1999 the US repealed parts of Glass-Steagall in retaliation and allowed for the merger of retail and investment banks once again. (Author's note - I worked for Citibank, a retail bank, at the time and was there during the merger with Salomon Smith Barney, a investment bank, a merger that formed Citigroup).\n\nFinancial services deregulation had a huge and permanent impact over the rest of the economy. Once the deal making and innovation of investment banks became merged with the huge financial power of retail banks, investment bankers could speculate on a level not seen since the 1920s. One practice that emerged was a drive for companies to pile on huge levels of debt, money which could be used to pay dividends, buy back shares or for management teams to buy their companies and to take them private.\n\nTo monitor the performance of these companies a new army of financial analysts emerged, hired from the top universities. They became increasingly demanding and wanted corporate management teams to provide semi annual and then quarterly projections of their income and cash flow statements and their balance sheets. Because investment banks took a small cut of the huge money flows that exchanged hands in these transactions they could pay their employees salaries that were higher than the best paid CEOs of large corporations. Smart graduates with engineering, maths and physics backgrounds, who had historically gone into industry were snapped up by investment banks and their hedge fund cousins.\n\nThe pre-eminence of the financial sector fundamentally changed the relationship between capital and corporations. Historically, wealth could only be made by investing in well-run businesses or in growing markets. With the advent of financial deregulation investors could take poorly performing companies, asset strip them or leverage them up with debt. The share prices of conservatively run companies stagnated compared to companies that were willing to take on higher levels of debt or to do things that made their quarterly financial results look good, whilst undermining the long term viability and profitability of their company.\n\nDuring the 1990s capital from the West, managed by western investment banks, started to flow outside the West and into emerging markets as investors looked for a way to make a higher return than they could at home. The US victory over the Soviet Union in 1991 made the US and Western model highly attractive to Third World countries, which were renamed \"Developing countries\". Waves of Western cash flooded into Asia and created speculative bubbles there, which helped to cause the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis that started in Thailand and then spread to Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nIn the US itself, investment banks and analysts looked for new ways of creating wealth and pumped resources into the newly emerging internet sector, which promised to up-end all industries. Companies with zero revenues but with lots of \"eyeballs\" were listed on NASDAQ and their founders became overnight millionaires or billionaires. (Author's note: I had an internet company at the time and remember puzzling over how I was going to divide up my hundreds of millions of dollars between my co-founders. They were crazy times.) The Internet bubble burst in the spring of 2000.\n\nPulling everything together\n\nSo by the time China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001 a perfect storm was beginning to gather that would destroy Western hegemony. Lets pull all the strands of this article together:\n\n- Western success over the Soviet Union meant that the West pursued an aggressive free-market policy around the world. As discussed earlier, this made more sense than the West's original mercantilist policy as the West believed it would always beat foreign competitors in a free trade contest.\n\nWestern success over the Soviet Union meant that the West pursued an aggressive free-market policy around the world.

Eager to make as much money as those in the financial services sector, management teams were incentivised to trade long term corporate performance for short-term gain, at the expense of long-term shareholders and to the demise of their own companies.\n\nFinancial services deregulation fundamentally altered the relationship between senior management teams, their shareholders and their companies.

Western companies set up manufacturing hubs in China to then sell goods back to the West. China offered aggressive incentives to Western companies, including tax free zones, assistance in recruiting millions of workers and minimal labour and environmental protection laws.\n\nChina's ascension to the World Trade Organisation enabled Western companies to trade with China on a scale that had hereto been impossible.

After the high inflationary period of the 1970s the West was particularly frightened of inflation: they had seen the consequences of runaway inflation in Germany and Austria during the 1930s.\n\nLow cost goods from China, and then other countries who jumped on the bandwagon, allowed for materially higher standards of living in the East without causing inflation in the West.

This disparity amounted to asymmetric warfare as the West's markets remained open to free trade whilst China discouraged domestic consumption. China focused on obtaining raw materials to then convert into manufactured products that were sold in exchange for US dollars, Euros and Sterling resulting. This policy led to a huge trade surplus and a massively high level of foreign reserves.\n\nChina was very aware of how the West had become so dominant since the 1450s and itself pursued a similar mercantilist trading philosophy.

China focused on obtaining raw materials to then convert into manufactured products that were sold in exchange for US dollars, Euros and Sterling resulting. This policy led to a huge trade surplus and a massively high level of foreign reserves.\n\n- China then recycled these foreign reserves back into the West by buying predominantly US government debt. Since the trade surplus was so large it meant that China quickly became one of the largest holders of US Treasury Bills, which made it easy for the US Treasury to issue government debt with low interest rates. It is for this reason that interest rates during the 2000s were so low for many Western countries.\n\nChina then recycled these foreign reserves back into the West by buying predominantly US government debt.

This meant that house prices went up significantly higher than inflation (which was kept artificially low by low cost goods from developing countries) which meant that people felt wealthier than they had previously. Many re-mortagaged their homes and took out equity in the form of cash which they then used to fund home extensions and renovations, purchase holidays, new cars and other items which further enhanced the supply of money in Western economies. Much of this money went to purchase goods made in China, further increasing China's foreign reserves.\n\nIn addition, since interest rates were so low this encouraged a boom in the housing market.

Investment banks encouraged their retail arms to lend money to poor people who would have been shunned as bad credits by traditional savings and loans banks (building societies in the UK). In the event that the customer was unable to repay their mortgage or make their interest payments, since property prices were going up investors believed that they were reasonably secure. To enhance the creditworthiness of these assets investment banks packaged thousands of these sub-prime loans with higher quality loans on the assumption that even if a few people went into default the risks would be spread out over millions of good quality loans. This did not quite work as planned and resulted in the 2007 financial crash which kicked off the Great Recession.\n\nAs more people were able to purchase homes, house prices kept going up.

Stock market analysts punished companies that did not have the ability to outsource more of their manufacturing, pushing their share prices lower. New management teams were then hired who pursued a more aggressive outsourcing model.\n\nAs more companies set up manufacturing centers in low cost countries such as China and other parts of South East Asia, it became increasingly difficult for Western companies to compete without following suit by also taking advantage of low cost labour and weak labour and environmental laws.

This included a requirement to set up joint ventures with Chinese state owned companies and to transfer critical technology and know how. This strategy has enabled China to rapidly move up the value chain since 2001, moving from the manufacture of cheap clothes and toys to making sophisticated wide bodied passenger planes to compete with Boeing and Airbus and high speed rail trains to compete with Alstom, Hitachi and Siemens. A similar transformation has occurred in the services sector in India, which has dominated the offshoring of back-office functions of law firms, accountants and big retail and investment banks.\n\nAs the Chinese economy grew, due to Western investment, China was able to strike increasingly hard bargains with Western companies eager to access the Chinese market.

Unemployment rates of over 50% for young people in parts of Europe will cause devastation for that entire generation. They will have lower incomes; will pay lower amounts of tax, which will impact pensions for the elderly and the ability to pay for services for themselves and for younger generations. Society will be split and those that have jobs will start to resent those that have no jobs and those with no jobs will look upon those with jobs with envy.\n\nThe consequent loss of jobs and good jobs is starting to cause a breakdown in Western societies.

Like Dr Faustus, who traded his soul to the devil for greater knowledge, the West traded away its Ricardian comparative advantages in a wide range of manufacturing and service sector roles; advantages built up over a century of accumulated intellectual know-how, in exchange for about eight years of unparalleled economic growth and prosperity that were fundamentally destructive to their economies.\n\nSo what does this mean for the future?\n\nDr Faustus begged the devil and God to have mercy on his soul and to release him from his agreement. What about the West? If we could go back in time or change our ways in the future what should we do? Future History Now offers two key possibilities.\n\nFirst, there must be an understanding that the West's development and wealth originally derived from mercantilism, not from free trade. Free trade only became desirable once the West was sufficiently advantaged compared to its likely competitors that it could compete freely, and guarantee that it would win every time.\n\nThe West must also accept that China is pursuing the same mercantilist practices that made the West successful. China is totally within its right to do this, and the practice makes sense for the Chinese government on behalf of its population. But in an asymmetric battle between one country pursuing a mercantilist policy and another country pursuing an open market and free trade policy, the mercantilist country should win out.\n\nSince the US cannot control what China does, and can only control US policy, the US and the West should respond with mercantilist policies of its own. This means shutting down Chinese imports of goods that could be made in the West until both parties can really operate on a level playing field - which includes wage and labour costs as well as environmental law parity.\n\nSecond, parts of the financial services sector have become dangerous for the overall health of the West's economy and society for a number of reasons, and need to be reformed.\n\nOn the consumer side, banks have enabled individual citizens to borrow funds on a level that is excessive. This has allowed individuals to feel wealthier than they really are, a nice feeling while it lasts, but ultimately leading to home foreclosures and personal bankruptcy. The excessive lending of money to the housing market has diverted capital from productive activities, such as investment into small businesses, into creating an inflationary bubble in the housing market, a sector with no intrinsic value other than as somewhere to live.\n\nOn the corporate side, banks have forced company management teams to act in the short-term interests of financial sector intermediaries, who make money whether share prices go up or down, instead of in the interests of their long term shareholders, employees and customers. These practices have included taking on high levels of corporate debt and outsourcing core parts of their business, including technical know-how, to future competitors.\n\nThe financial services sector is also taking too many of the best and brightest from our top universities. Top Western graduates are making a rational decision: why work hard as an engineer in a declining manufacturing company with low status and low pay when you can earn a fortune by skimming a small percentage off the huge financial flows of companies all over the world.\n\nMany parts of financial sector deregulation have resulted in great benefits to society and the economy. Unpicking the good parts from the bad will be no easy task.\n\nThere is hope\n\nWhile the West may be in trouble today it is not impossible to imagine a move by Western governments to restrict trade with China and other countries that are aggressively mercantilist. Equally, financial sector reform to fix the worst excesses, despite the powerful lobbying efforts from the financial sector, is not impossible either.\n\nBut few politicians are leaders. To lead requires going out ahead of the crowd, not knowing whether anybody else is following. This is frightening for modern career politicians: going too far from the crowd could mean the end of your political career. Instead most politicians act as mirrors, using polls to reflect back from the public what the public wants to see and believe.\n\nBut most people are too busy with their normal lives to understand everything that is needed for good governance. They have jobs, families, children, hobbies and concerns that fully occupy their time. To expect them to have a full understanding of historical precedent, monetary policy, foreign affairs and so forth is unfair and unrealistic.\n\nThat is why we have a representative democracy. Our politicians are elected to represent the people. Their job is to understand these issues and to use their judgement to push for policies that are for the benefit of the people that they were elected to represent.\n\nHistory Future Now has a large following of politicians and members of the military. So this is a message to you: this article is a relatively short synthesis of a huge number of interconnecting problems. Read it, think about it and forward it to your colleagues.\n\nAnd then lead! Lead from the front and call for reforms of our trade policy. Call for reforms of our financial sector.\n\nOur entire way of life hangs in the balance.\n\nYou may be our only hope.\n\nThe North African Threat And Mediterranean Reunification",

The transformation from pacifist republic to continental war machine took less time than it takes to pay off a car loan.\n\nThis is not an anomaly in European history. It is the pattern.\n\nIn February 2026, European leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference to discuss how to spend EUR 800 billion on defence over the next four years, as part of the EU's \"ReArm Europe\" plan. NATO members have committed to spending 3.5% of GDP on core defence by 2035, with an additional 1.5% on military infrastructure and resilience -- a total of 5%. Poland is already spending over 4%. Germany has created a EUR 100 billion special fund. Even historically neutral countries like Finland and Sweden have joined NATO.\n\nWhat is happening right now is the sixth great European rearmament cycle in 400 years. History Future Now has tracked the previous five. Each followed the same basic template: a devastating war exhausts the continent; a period of relief and disarmament follows; a new threat emerges; there is a scramble to rearm; and then either deterrence holds, or war breaks out.\n\nThe critical question is not whether Europe should rearm. Given Russia's invasion of Ukraine, America's increasingly transactional approach to NATO, and China's expanding military reach, the case for stronger European defences is self-evident. The critical question is whether Europeans can break the historical pattern -- whether this time, rearmament leads to sustained deterrence rather than to the catastrophe that has followed every previous cycle.\n\nThe Cycle\n\nTo understand the present you need to understand the pattern. Europe has gone through five distinct cycles of disarmament followed by frantic rearmament since the modern state system emerged in 1648. The dates are approximate, but the rhythm is unmistakable.\n\nThe first cycle ran from the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 to the Wars of Louis XIV. The Thirty Years' War had been the most destructive conflict in European history. It killed between 20% and 40% of Germany's population and left much of Central Europe in ruins. The Peace of Westphalia was supposed to establish a new order based on state sovereignty and religious tolerance. For a few decades it worked. Military spending declined, armies shrank, and Europe recovered.\n\nBut France, under Louis XIV, used this period of relative peace to build the most formidable military on the continent. When war came again -- the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701 -- France's neighbours had to scramble to rearm, forming expensive coalitions to contain French power. It would take 14 years of fighting across Europe and the Americas before the matter was settled. The pattern was established: peace was merely the incubation period for the next conflict.\n\nThe second cycle ran from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the Crimean War. Napoleon's campaigns had killed between 3 and 7 million people and redrawn the political map of Europe. The Concert of Europe, established at the Congress of Vienna, ushered in a period of relative peace among the great powers. Britain's Royal Navy enforced a rough global order and military spending in continental Europe declined as governments turned their attention to industrialisation and internal reform.\n\nBut complacency set in. When Russia's expansionism in the Black Sea region eventually forced Britain and France to intervene in Crimea in 1854, they discovered how quickly military capabilities had atrophied during forty years of peace. British soldiers arrived with equipment essentially unchanged since Waterloo. The logistics were catastrophic. More men died of disease than from enemy fire. Florence Nightingale became famous not because she was a great nurse, but because the medical provision for British soldiers was so appallingly inadequate that a wealthy woman with a talent for organisation could outperform the entire military establishment.\n\nThe third cycle, from the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, was different. This time there was no extended period of disarmament. Instead, Bismarck's unification of Germany under Prussian leadership in 1871 triggered a continuous peacetime arms race that lasted over four decades. France, humiliated by its rapid defeat, rebuilt its military. Germany, fearing encirclement, expanded its army and built a world-class navy. Russia modernised. Britain, alarmed by Germany's naval ambitions, launched the Dreadnought programme, which rendered all existing battleships obsolete overnight, including its own.\n\nBy 1914 European powers were spending between 3% and 5% of GDP on defence -- enormous sums for the era. This arms race did not prevent war. Many historians argue it made war more likely, because each nation became convinced that its window of military advantage was closing and that it was better to fight now than to fight later.\n\nThe fourth cycle, from the Armistice in 1918 to the outbreak of World War II in 1939, is the one that most closely mirrors what is happening in Europe today. After the carnage of the Western Front, European publics wanted nothing to do with war. The prevailing mood was captured by the famous Oxford Union debate of 1933, in which students voted that \"This house will under no circumstances fight for its King and Country.\" Military budgets were slashed across the continent.\n\nBritain adopted the Ten Year Rule in 1919, which assumed that there would be no major war for at least a decade and planned defence spending accordingly. The rule was renewed annually until 1932. France poured its limited military budget into the Maginot Line, a purely defensive fortification that reflected the nation's psychological exhaustion. The assumption behind the Maginot Line was that the next war would be like the last one -- a static, attritional grind. It was not. Germany rearmed in secret and then openly. From 1% of GDP in 1932, German military spending surged to 23% of GDP by 1939. The Rhineland was remilitarised in 1936. Austria was absorbed in 1938. Czechoslovakia was dismembered the same year. Britain and France, having allowed their militaries to atrophy, were in no position to respond with anything other than appeasement and stern words.\n\nWhen war came in September 1939, the democracies had to rearm in a desperate rush, under the worst possible conditions. The results were predictable. France fell in six weeks. Britain survived only because of the English Channel and the Royal Air Force, and even then it required American financial support to stay in the fight.\n\nThe fifth cycle ran from the end of the Cold War in 1991 to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This was the most dramatic European disarmament in modern history. The collapse of the Soviet Union triggered what was euphemistically called the \"peace dividend\" -- a sustained, continent-wide drawdown in military capability that lasted three decades.\n\nThe Three Decades of Peace Dividend\n\nThe numbers tell the story. Germany reduced its active military from 585,000 in 1990 to 183,000 by 2023. The Bundeswehr went from having 7,000 main battle tanks to fewer than 300. The Netherlands sold its entire tank fleet. Belgium's military became so underfunded that soldiers reportedly had to shout \"bang bang\" during exercises because they lacked live ammunition for training. Italy's defence budget stagnated for decades. Spain treated NATO's 2% of GDP target as an aspiration rather than a commitment. Even Britain, which prided itself on maintaining a serious military, cut its army to its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe assumptions underlying this disarmament were threefold: that Russia had been permanently defanged; that America would always guarantee European security through NATO; and that economic interdependence had made large-scale war in Europe impossible.\n\nAll three proved wrong. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, annexed Crimea in 2014, and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. America's commitment to European defence became increasingly conditional, first under Barack Obama's \"pivot to Asia,\" then more dramatically under Donald Trump, who openly questioned whether the United States would honour Article 5 for allies that refused to spend adequately on their own defence. And economic interdependence, far from preventing conflict, gave Russia leverage over Europe through energy dependence -- as Europeans discovered to their horror when gas prices quadrupled after the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Western European NATO members collectively maintained roughly 3 million men under arms, backed by tens of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery pieces, and combat aircraft. West Germany alone fielded 12 army divisions and could mobilise a further 6 within days. The infrastructure to support this military -- barracks, ammunition depots, fuel storage, command centres, training grounds -- was vast.\n\nAfter 1991, all of this was systematically dismantled. Barracks were closed or converted into housing. Ammunition depots were emptied and the ammunition was destroyed or sold off. Training grounds were returned to civilian use. Factories that had produced tanks, artillery shells, and military vehicles either closed, converted to civilian production, or dramatically reduced their capacity. The skilled workforce -- the engineers, technicians, and craftsmen who knew how to build military equipment -- retired and were not replaced.\n\nThis went far beyond sensible post-Cold War adjustment. What happened was the deliberate dismantling of the industrial base needed to produce military equipment at scale. European governments were not just spending less on defence. They were destroying the ability to spend more in the future, even if they wanted to.\n\nThe consequences became brutally apparent after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. When the EU pledged to deliver one million artillery shells to Ukraine within a year, it could not meet the target. Rheinmetall, one of Europe's largest defence companies, was producing around 70,000 artillery shells per year. Russia was producing an estimated 3 million. The EU's combined GDP was over ten times Russia's, but it could produce a fraction of Russia's military output. The problem was not money. It was capacity.\n\nTo put this in historical context, during World War II the United States went from producing 800 military aircraft in 1939 to over 96,000 in 1944. Britain went from 3,000 to 26,000. Even the Soviet Union, which lost most of its industrial heartland to the German invasion, relocated over 1,500 factories east of the Urals and was outproducing Germany by 1943. Today's Europe, with all its wealth, cannot produce enough basic ammunition for a single war in Ukraine.\n\nThis is what three decades of peace dividend actually bought: an atrophied industrial base, a hollowed-out military, and the comfortable assumption that serious conflict in Europe was over for good.\n\nThe Geography of Fear\n\nOne of the most striking features of today's rearmament is how closely it correlates with geography. There is an almost perfect relationship between a European country's distance from Russia and its willingness to spend on defence.\n\nPoland, which borders both Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and Russia's ally Belarus, is spending over 4% of GDP on defence -- more than twice the old NATO target. The three Baltic states, each of which has a significant Russian-speaking minority and traumatic memories of Soviet occupation, are spending between 3% and 6% of GDP. Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometre border with Russia and which was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1939, abandoned its long-standing neutrality to join NATO. Norway, which borders Russia in the Arctic, is spending over 3%.\n\nThen look at the other end of the scale. Spain explicitly refused to commit to NATO's new 3.5% target, with Prime Minister Sánchez capping defence spending at 2.1% of GDP and declaring it \"sufficient.\" Italy's defence budget is expected to remain flat through 2027. Portugal and Belgium have been slow to increase spending.\n\nThis geographical divide echoes every previous rearmament cycle. In the 1930s, the countries closest to Germany -- Czechoslovakia, Poland, France -- were the most alarmed and most willing to arm. Britain, separated by the English Channel, was slower to react. The United States, separated by an ocean, was slowest of all.\n\nGeography shapes threat perception. Threat perception shapes spending. Uneven spending creates fault lines within alliances. Today, Poland and the Baltic states are frustrated by what they see as Western European complacency. They look at Spain spending 2.1% and wonder what exactly Spain thinks NATO membership entails. France and Germany talk about \"European strategic autonomy\" -- the ability to act independently of America -- while Eastern European members remain deeply sceptical of any framework that weakens the American security guarantee. A Pole or an Estonian looks at a French proposal for European strategic autonomy and sees, quite rationally, an invitation to replace a reliable American guarantee with an unreliable French one.\n\nThese divisions are manageable during peacetime. They would become critical in a crisis.\n\nThe EUR 800 Billion Question\n\nSo Europe is rearming. The question is whether it can do so effectively.\n\nThe scale of the challenge is daunting. Europe currently has 27 separate national armies within the EU alone. It operates 20 different types of main battle tank, where the US operates one. It has 29 different classes of naval frigate, where the US has one. It uses 12 different types of infantry fighting vehicle. This fragmentation means that European armed forces cannot easily share ammunition, spare parts, communications systems, or logistics infrastructure. Two European armies standing side by side on the same battlefield might not be able to talk to each other.\n\nThe fragmentation also means that Europe gets far less military capability per euro than it should. The EU collectively spent EUR 343 billion on defence in 2024, versus Russia's reported EUR 107 billion. But Russia gets considerably more fighting power for its money because it has one army, one procurement system, one logistics chain, and one command structure. Europe's defence spending is spread across 27 separate bureaucracies, each with its own priorities, its own domestic defence industry to protect, and its own political constraints.\n\nIn 2022-2023, 78% of European defence procurement was sourced from outside Europe, with 63% coming from the United States. Europe is, in effect, paying America to defend it through purchases of American weapons, while simultaneously talking about strategic autonomy from America. The contradiction is so obvious that it hardly needs pointing out.\n\nThe ReArm Europe plan attempts to address some of this by encouraging joint procurement and incentivising European defence industrial cooperation. The EUR 150 billion SAFE loan mechanism and the broader EUR 800 billion spending framework are designed to channel money toward European producers and encourage countries to buy the same equipment. Whether this will work is another matter. Joint European procurement programmes have a dismal track record. The Eurofighter Typhoon, designed by four countries, took 23 years from design to full production and cost far more than originally budgeted. The A400M military transport aircraft was seven years late and billions over budget.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that defence procurement is industrial policy, and every European government wants its domestic industry to benefit. Germany wants Leopard tanks built in Germany. France wants Rafale fighters built in France. Italy wants naval vessels built in Italy. Each country's defence minister answers to a domestic electorate that cares about local jobs, not about pan-European military efficiency. Until that political incentive changes, European defence spending will continue to produce less capability than it should.\n\nWhy This Time Might Be Different\n\nThere are, however, reasons to think that this sixth cycle could break the historical pattern.\n\nFirst, nuclear weapons have fundamentally altered the calculus of war between great powers. In every previous cycle, the rearmament phase eventually led to a major war because the perceived cost of fighting was bearable. Nations could fight, lose, recover, and fight again within a generation. Nuclear weapons make total war between nuclear-armed powers suicidal. This means that rearmament can sustain a permanent standoff without escalating to open conflict -- as it did during the Cold War. The Cold War was, in many respects, the first time the pattern was broken: massive rearmament on both sides that led to deterrence, not war.\n\nSecond, the institutional framework is incomparably stronger than in any previous cycle. NATO provides a coordinating mechanism that simply did not exist before 1949. The EU adds another layer of economic and political cooperation. Previous rearmament cycles were characterised by shifting alliances, mutual suspicion, and the absence of any credible collective security mechanism. Each nation armed independently and feared its neighbours' preparations as much as any external threat. That dynamic is substantially different today. Germany and France are not rearming against each other. They are rearming together.\n\nThird, the economic foundation for European rearmament is solid. The EU's combined GDP exceeds $18 trillion -- larger than China's and four times Russia's. Europe has the economic capacity to sustain 3.5% of GDP on defence without the ruinous trade-offs that characterised earlier cycles. European societies are wealthy enough to afford both welfare states and serious defence, if they choose to.\n\nBut history offers uncomfortable warnings as well.\n\nWhat Nobody Is Talking About\n\nEvery previous rearmament cycle changed the societies that undertook it. Once military-industrial complexes are built, they develop their own political constituencies, their own institutional momentum, and their own logic. President Eisenhower's warning about the \"military-industrial complex\" in his 1961 farewell address was not hypothetical. It was based on his direct observation, as both a general and a president, of how defence spending creates self-perpetuating demand for more defence spending. Contractors lobby for new programmes. Generals argue for more capabilities. Politicians compete to bring military spending to their constituencies. The result is a ratchet effect: defence budgets go up but they rarely come back down.\n\nEurope's historically low military spending since 1991 has been one of the foundations of its generous welfare states. The money that did not go to tanks and fighter jets went to healthcare, pensions, education, and social housing. Shifting hundreds of billions toward defence will create real pressure on social budgets, particularly in countries that are already running significant deficits. France's debt-to-GDP ratio is already over 110%. Italy's is over 140%. The idea that these countries can find an additional 1.5% to 3% of GDP for defence without cutting something else is optimistic at best.\n\nThen there is the question of where the threat goes next. The current rearmament is premised on a specific threat: Russia. European governments are spending more because Russia invaded Ukraine and because Russia might, in the future, threaten NATO territory. This is a rational response.\n\nBut the geopolitical landscape of the 2040s and 2050s will not look like the geopolitical landscape of the 2020s. China's military power is growing at a rate that dwarfs Russia's. Africa's population is set to double by 2050, from 1.4 billion to 2.8 billion, and the continent's northern coast is just 14 kilometres from Europe at the Strait of Gibraltar. The Mediterranean, which History Future Now has written about extensively, could become a contested frontier again as climate change, water scarcity, and population pressure drive instability in North Africa and the Middle East. A well-armed Europe in the 2040s may find itself facing challenges that have nothing to do with Russia and using its military capabilities in ways that its citizens never anticipated.\n\nThis is not speculation. It is the pattern. In the 1930s, Britain rearmed against Germany. Twenty years later it was in a Cold War against the Soviet Union. In the 1950s, America armed to fight the Soviets. Fifteen years later it was using that military in Vietnam. The weapons you build for one threat get used for another.\n\nThe Twist\n\nBut there is one final dimension to this story that takes us beyond the familiar cycle, and it may be the most consequential of all.\n\nEurope has attempted, over the past 80 years, one of the most extraordinary political experiments in human history: the peaceful integration of nations that spent centuries trying to destroy each other. France and Germany, which fought three devastating wars between 1870 and 1945, are now so economically intertwined that armed conflict between them is essentially unthinkable. This achievement is often dismissed as naive idealism. It is nothing of the sort. It is one of the most remarkable accomplishments in the history of statecraft.\n\nWhat if European rearmament, done correctly, actually accelerates this integration?\n\nConsider the logic. If European nations want genuine military capability for their EUR 800 billion, they cannot achieve it as 27 separate countries buying 20 different tanks. They will have to rationalise, standardise, and integrate their defence industries. They will need joint procurement systems, shared logistics chains, common communications platforms, and interoperable command structures. They will have to do in defence what they have already done in trade, regulation, and monetary policy.\n\nThis is precisely what happened in the United States. Before the Civil War, each American state had its own militia with its own equipment, training, and command structure. The enormous military mobilisations required by the Civil War, and later by the two World Wars, forced the creation of a genuinely national military -- and that national military became one of the most powerful integrating forces in American society. Young men from Alabama trained alongside young men from Massachusetts. They used the same equipment, followed the same orders, and developed shared loyalties that transcended their state identities.\n\nEuropean rearmament could, paradoxically, be the catalyst that finally forces the creation of integrated European defence. Not out of idealism, but out of necessity. When you are spending 5% of GDP on security, you simply cannot afford to waste it on duplication and fragmentation. The economic pressure to consolidate will be immense. And consolidation in defence tends to spill over into other areas -- shared industrial policy, common foreign policy, integrated command and control.\n\nIf this happens -- and it is a very big if -- then Europe's sixth rearmament cycle would produce something genuinely unprecedented in the continent's 400-year history of rearmament cycles: a collective military capability that makes the continent more secure without making it more dangerous. Not 27 separate armies that might, in a crisis, turn on each other, as they have done in every previous century -- but a single defensive force that is too strong for any external power to challenge and too deeply integrated for any single member to misuse.\n\nThe European Union was born from the ashes of the Second World War. Its founding insight, embedded in the European Coal and Steel Community of 1951, was that countries that share their steel industry cannot easily go to war with each other. The next step in that logic is that countries that share an army cannot go to war with each other at all.\n\nThat would genuinely break the pattern. That would be the most important strategic development of the twenty-first century. And it would transform a continent that invented total war into the most powerful force for stability the world has ever seen.\n\nWhether Europe is wise enough to achieve it is the EUR 800 billion question.\n\nBut consider this final thought -- and it is the thought that should make you send this article to someone you care about.\n\nEvery person alive in Europe today was born during an anomaly. The 80 years since 1945 represent the longest period of great-power peace in European history. Not the longest period of peace -- there were wars in Yugoslavia, in Ukraine, in the Caucasus. But the longest period without a direct military conflict between major European states. No France versus Germany. No Britain versus anyone on the continent. No coalition wars, no continental conflagrations, no conscription of an entire generation.\n\nThis is not normal. For the previous 400 years, major European wars occurred roughly every 30 to 40 years. The average European born in 1600 had a high probability of experiencing at least one devastating continental conflict in their lifetime. The average European born in 1950 experienced none.\n\nWe have lived our entire lives inside the exception. We have mistaken the exception for the rule. We have built our economies, our welfare states, our retirement plans, our assumptions about the future, on the foundation of a peace that, historically, is wildly improbable.\n\nThe EUR 800 billion now being poured into European defence is, at its core, an insurance premium on the most valuable anomaly in European history. The question is not whether Europe can afford to pay it. It is whether Europe can afford not to -- and whether, having started, it can do what no previous generation of Europeans has managed: turn the machinery of war permanently into the architecture of peace.\n\nThe bill has arrived. The answer will define the century.\n\nThe Rise Of The West Was Based On Luck. That Has Run Out.",

History, however, offers a more nuanced perspective. Time and again, wars that once seemed intractable have eventually found resolutions, however imperfect or painful.\n\nFrom the neutrality imposed on once-belligerent states, to the pragmatic federalization of fractured nations, the ethnic partitions that divided lands and peoples, and the territorial losses enforced by decisive military victories, the annals of the past are replete with examples of how even the most vicious wars can be brought to an end through diplomacy. It is these well-trodden paths that may hold the key to unlocking peace in Ukraine.\n\nThis article explores the hard-learned lessons from how the major conflagrations spanning 300 years of human conflict concluded. In doing so, it aims to discern a route forward for the current crisis - one that acknowledges the harsh realities of geopolitical compromise, but also the moral imperatives of sparing civilians further misery. For as History Future Now has long maintained, it is only by understanding our past that we can hope to build a better future.\n\nAmong the potential paths to peace, the imposition of official neutrality has proven to be an effective, if often unpalatable, resolution to conflicts spanning centuries. The precedents are numerous:\n\nIn the aftermath of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 established Belgian territories as a \"Perpetually Neutral State\" to act as a buffer zone between France and the Dutch Republic. This enforced neutrality ultimately paved the way for an independent Belgian nation over a century later.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna reorganized Europe's political geography in 1815, enshrining the principle of neutrality for Switzerland. Despite being at the heart of the continent's power struggles, the Swiss Confederation was prohibited from joining future military alliances and hosting foreign armies - a status it maintains to this day.\n\nA century later, the armistice that ended World War I's bloodletting enforced strict demilitarization and neutrality on the Netherlands. Under the terms of the 1919 settlement, the Dutch were barred from joining military alliances, while their sovereign territory was subject to allied oversight to uphold the restrictive peace terms.\n\nMore recently, the Austrian State Treaty of 1955 paved the way for a fully independent and officially neutral Austria after a decade of four-power occupation following World War II. The settlement prohibited union with Germany and barred Austria from hosting foreign military forces - a controversial condition given the Soviet fears of a remilitarised, U.S.-aligned stronghold on their borders.\n\nCould a similar policy of legally-enshrined permanent neutrality be the key to resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict? The potential benefits are evident: By committing to non-alignment and agreeing not to join NATO or host foreign forces or bases, Ukraine could alleviate core Russian security concerns that Moscow has long cited as the pretext for its invasion.\n\nIn exchange, Russia would be compelled to withdraw its forces from all internationally-recognized Ukrainian territory aside from Crimea, while robust international security guarantees - potentially involving U.N. peacekeepers to monitor the demilitarized borders - would preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nYet as the Dutch and Austrian examples illustrate, any such settlement would constitute a bitter concession for Ukraine. Having fought and bled to defend its independence, being forced to relinquish its sovereign right to self-determination on future alliances could prove an unacceptable price. There is also the risk that a neutrality agreement, however legally binding, may only delay rather than permanently resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict if residual grievances fester.\n\nUltimately, while flawed, the model of imposed neutrality stands as one of the few historically-proven formulas for halting even the most protracted and vicious wars through pragmatic compromise. As the coming sections explore, it is merely one of several potential pathways the world may choose to pursue in its quest to forge a sustainable peace in Ukraine.\n\nWhen the fires of civil war have burnt themselves out, one path that has repeatedly emerged from the ashes is the federalization of the conflicted state along ethnic, linguistic or geographic lines. By devolving significant autonomy to feuding regions while preserving a unified national framework, such federal solutions have proven to be effective, if imperfect, means of resolving sectarian tensions.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example is the conclusion of the American Civil War in 1865. Despite the Union's military victory over the Confederate secessionists, pragmatism ultimately prevailed. Under the framework of Reconstruction, the former rebel states were gradually re-admitted as semi-autonomous members of an enduring federal republic. This allowed for the preservation of state identities and local decision-making while enshrining national unity and civil rights protections for all citizens.\n\nA more contemporary model can be found in the Dayton Accords of 1995, which finally ended the bloody Yugoslav Wars. The settlement crystallized Bosnia and Herzegovina as a highly decentralized federal state composed of two sub-national entities - the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska and a Bosniak/Croat federation. While imperfect, the federal structure prevented further ethnic cleansing while allowing the warring peoples a degree of self-governance.\n\nAnother example is the 1995 Sudanese Peace Agreement that ended the First Sudanese Civil War by granting autonomy and a federal system to the south, despite leaving many underlying grievances unresolved that reignited conflict in 1983. This illustrates both the potential and limitations of federal solutions.\n\nIn Ukraine's case, could a similar federalization potentially break the current impasse with Russia? One possibility is the reorganization of Ukraine into a loosely-bound federation. The Russian-speaking Donbas republics of Donetsk and Luhansk could be granted expansive autonomy over economic, cultural and legislative affairs while remaining nominally under Kyiv's jurisdiction. This internal solution could persuade Moscow to accept the territories' reintegration within Ukraine's borders.\n\nThe challenges, however, are immense. After years of fighting Russian-backed separatists, Kyiv may be unwilling to cede such sweeping powers to regions it perceives as being under foreign occupation. Federalization could also embolden other pro-Russian oblasts to demand similar autonomy, progressively decentralizing Ukraine. There are also concerns that such an arrangement simply delays further conflict by leaving the root issues of the Donbas unresolved indefinitely.\n\nYet if federalisation prevented even a fraction of the devastation witnessed in Bosnia or the U.S. Civil War's Reconstruction Era, it could represent an imperfect but pragmatic compromise to halt Ukraine's suffering. As World War I's ruinous aftershocks demonstrated, forcing defeated peoples into permanent subjugation often plants the seeds for future conflicts.\n\nAt the bleakest nadir of ceaseless war, when all other options have been exhausted, a final resolution historically remains: the permanent ethnic or territorial partition of the disputed lands themselves. By acceding to the divisions that fueled the original conflict, such partitions have repeatedly allowed warring peoples to extricate themselves into separate sovereign realities.\n\nOne of the earliest and most seismic examples was the 1667 Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth following years of Russian invasion and civil strife. The settlement formally divided the once-powerful kingdom along the Dnieper River, with the western Polonized territories becoming a Russian satellite while Lithuania proper fell under Swedish control. The partition formalized the diverging futures of the slavic peoples.\n\nOver two centuries later, the traumatic Partition of India in 1947 ended the Indian independence movement at the cost of unspeakable violence. As British colonial rule fractured, the new dominions of India and Pakistan were established by carving apart the subcontinent along religious lines. Over 10 million people were uprooted and up to 2 million perished in sectarian bloodshed, but the partition established the foundations of the modern nation-states.\n\nThe partitions of Korea in 1945 and Vietnam in 1954 along the 38th and 17th Parallels respectively were interim measures after World War II that similarly formalised separations to end active conflicts, despite resulting in further civil wars between the divergent states.\n\nCould some form of negotiated partition potentially provide a resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, however abhorrent the human costs? One potential scenario is a negotiated division along linguistic lines. Russian forces withdraw from all of Ukraine aside from Crimea and the Donbas republics, which are ceded to Russia. Meanwhile, Russian-speaking populations in other Ukrainian oblasts are granted a window to emigrate to Russia or the newly-annexed territories.\n\nThe advantages are obvious - it conclusively solves the driving issue of sovereignty over Russian-majority lands. Yet the practical and ethical implications are staggering. Millions of civilians would be forced from their homes based on ethnicity, upending the very principle of national self-determination that sparked the war. There are also complex questions of navigating vital economic links, energy infrastructure, and the rights of minorities in each proto-state.\n\nUltimately, any partition plan would be a tragic last resort. As the harrowing aftermath of India's Partition showed, ethnic unmixing solves conflicts by formalizing segregation into official national policy. It is a grim path that should only be contemplated when all other options have been truly exhausted.\n\nYet history has proven that even such draconian measures can end cycles of perpetual violence when both sides accept the inescapable realities. For Ukraine, the most humanitarian path forward may ultimately lie in acknowledging what can and cannot be territorially preserved.\n\nThroughout the centuries, some of history's most brutal conflicts found their denouement not through diplomacy, but via the overwhelming military subjugation of one side by the other. The resulting peace settlements were then dictated by the victor, regardless of the human cost.\n\nThe Seven Years' War of the mid-18th century is a prime example. Initiated by the rivalry between Prussia and Austria for regional hegemony, it eventually drew in all the major European powers in a vicious cycle of shifting alliances and colonial conquests. After years of bloodshed across multiple continents, the war ended in 1763 with the Treaty of Hubertusburg - a resolution which formalised Prussia's territorial aggrandisement at the expense of the defeated Austrian Empire.\n\nThe conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars themselves in 1815 saw France decisively defeated and occupied by Allied forces, resulting in territorial losses, reparations and restrictions on its military under the Treaty of Paris and Final Act of the Congress of Vienna.\n\nA more contemporary precedent is the First Gulf War of 1991. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a U.S.-led multinational coalition comprehensively defeated Saddam Hussein's forces through a devastating air campaign and ground operation. The resultant peace terms were severe - Iraq was forced to withdraw from Kuwait, pay reparations, destroy its weapons of mass destruction, and submit to crippling economic sanctions and no-fly zones that preserved the status quo for over a decade.\n\nCould such a decisive military victory by one side over the other provide the eventual key to unlocking peace in Ukraine? From Russia's perspective, a campaign of overwhelming force to definitively defeat Ukraine's defenses could compel Kyiv to eventually accede to Moscow's core demands - permanent Russian control over Crimea and the Donbas, constitutional neutrality barring NATO membership, and perhaps even territory concessions.\n\nYet despite its public bluster, Russia has thus far manifestly failed to achieve such a military outcome. Its forces remain bogged down by fiercer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, exposing the limits of Russia's actual martial capabilities. For Ukraine, the human costs of even tactical Russian successes have proven catastrophic, making the notion of complete capitulation unthinkable.\n\nShort of full-scale intervention by NATO forces to decisively rout Russia - an unprecedentedly escalatory scenario - an outright military victor capable of unilaterally dictating peace terms seems elusive. The path of imposed peace through overwhelming conquest appears improbable for either side, at least over the foreseeable future.\n\nIf military victory remains implausible for now, that leaves only one remaining path out of the morass of Ukraine's conflict - a negotiated diplomatic settlement arduous enough to address the fundamental grievances driving both sides. History has proven that even the most difficult wars can eventually find resolution through robust peace processes and territorial reorganisation.\n\nThe Treaties of Münster and Osnabrück in 1648, collectively known as the Peace of Westphalia, ended the century of continental carnage triggered by the Thirty Years' War. Through gruelling diplomacy under the auspices of Norway and Sweden as mediators, the settlement reorganised large swathes of Europe's borders, granting sovereignty and religious rights to the warring principalities of the collapsed Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent in 1814 ending the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States is considered an early example of a pragmatic \"peace without victors\" through negotiated settlement that essentially restored pre-war realities and borders.\n\nSimilarly, the Congress of Vienna in 1815 represented the international community's attempt to restore stability and prevent further conflict in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars. Over months of complex negotiations, borders were redrawn, spheres of influence reapportioned, and the outlines of a balance of power dictated across Europe. While flawed, the settlement helped maintain an uneasy continental peace for nearly four decades.\n\nFor Ukraine, any such \"Westphalian\" resolution would likely require the involvement of the United Nations and other global bodies as neutral brokers in negotiating an intricate series of territorial, political, security and economic accords. Russia would have to make tangible concessions on its core aims of absorbing the Donbas and Crimea into the Russian Federation in exchange for security guarantees restricting Ukraine's westward geopolitical pivot.\n\nKyiv, in turn, may have to begrudgingly accept some form of constitutionally-enshrined neutrality barring future NATO membership, along with robust protections for Russian minorities in return for preserving its truncated sovereignty and independence. Both sides would also have to confront complex humanitarian issues like refugees and governance of the occupied/contested areas.\n\nIt would be a fraught, imperfect and likely rancorous process - but perhaps the only path that respects Ukraine's territorial integrity and Russia's stated security concerns without sowing the seeds for further conflicts. As ceasefires and preliminary negotiations have continually faltered, a robust, internationally-backed comprehensive peace process may ultimately represent the best path forward.\n\nCrucially, a diplomatic settlement premised on mutual concessions addresses the reality that neither Russia nor Ukraine can achieve an outright military victory in this conflict, no matter how much more blood is spilled. The human catastrophe can only be ended by pragmatic abnegation of each side's maximal aims in favour of a sustainable, if unsatisfying, arrangement.\n\nAs this exploration of three centuries of warfare has demonstrated, schemic conflicts can find resolutions through a multitude of eventual pathways - from neutrality and federalization, to partitions and decisive military victories, to comprehensive diplomatic settlements. Each approach has its own historical precedents to learn from, for better or worse.\n\nUkraine's ultimate path to peace may very well incorporate elements of multiple resolutions - perhaps a federalized regions with Russian autonomy and security guarantees coupled with internationally-monitored referendums to decisively settle the question of Crimea. Or it could see a partition of the Russian-majority lands through negotiated population transfers and border redraws. Or, most optimistically, a grand diplomatic process that makes incremental compromises acceptable to all sides involved.\n\nWhat is clear from the long shadow of history is that even the most existential conflicts can eventually find political resolution once the human costs of perpetual war are deemed too steep. Ukraine, for all the horror it has endured, is unlikely to be the exception that shatters this foundational tenet of diplomacy and statecraft.\n\nForging a lasting peace will require all actors involved to confront harsh realities, abandon unattainable ideals, and engage in the type of candid give-and-take that so often proves elusive even for democratic societies - let alone authoritarian ones. It is an immense challenge, but one made slightly more tenable when guided by the examples hewn from centuries of human struggle for conflict resolution.\n\nFor as History Future Now has continually emphasized, it is only by understanding our past that we can hope to learn, to grow, and to build a better, more sustainable path into the future. On the road out of Ukraine's abyss of violence, the footsteps of those who trod similar paths before may prove to be the vital lodestar in these current darkest hours.",

However, History Future Now is going to look at this in the context of a wider problem, which is why politicians and senior business leaders make decisions that are not in a country or society's long term interests.\n\nTo to this we are going to briefly go back to the 1789 French Revolution, where the concept of Left and Right wing developed, and then to the more modern concepts of Open and Closed societies and finally to the concept of a society split into people who are Beams and Columns.\n\nTurning away from Left and Right and moving to Open and Closed\n\nSeparating political affiliation into \"the Left\" and \"the Right\" came about in 1789, at the beginning of the French Revolution. Those that were loyal to the church and the king took up positions to the right of the presiding chair in the newly formed National Assembly to avoid being tormented by the working class factions in the Third Estate that opposed them on the left of the chair.\n\nOver the past few decades political parties have tried to stay as close to the centre as possible, where it has been easier to pick up votes. In the UK, for example, left of centre Blair was deemed the heir to right of centre Thatcher. His political leanings were so tied to historically right wing policies that it is sometimes hard to remember that he was the leader of the Labour party and not the Conservative party. Many in the left of the Labour party hate him to this day. Those in the right of the Labour party love the fact that he made them electable.\n\nBut simply putting people into Left and Right wing camps has felt odd for over a decade and the rise of Trump in the US and the vote for Brexit in the UK has created a dilemma for political scientists: these categories no longer seem to make any sense. In the UK, traditional Left wing working classes were united with traditional Right wing land owners. Free market liberals were united with nationalists who were anti immigration and international trade agreements. In the US, much of Trump's support is linked to similar coalitions of seemingly unconnected voters.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that society is now split into those that are Open and those that are Closed. In this analysis society is split into those who are largely Globalists and Nationalists in their outlooks. Globalists embrace free trade and an open society. Nationalists focus on closing themselves off from the interference of outside parties and want to promote what is best for their countries first.\n\nThere is a lot of merit in this analysis. However, there are large contradictions. For example, in the Brexit camp - who are deemed as Nationalists - many of those who wanted to take back control of their sovereignty from the EU (Closed) are very much in favour of free trade with everyone (Open), including proposals to drop all trade barriers to the UK unilaterally. They are aligned with people who are alarmed by the concept of free trade (Closed) as it would signal significant job losses in manufacturing and in agriculture in particular.\n\nBeams and Columns\n\nAn alternative way to look at politics today is to separate people into those who are Beams and those who are Columns. Beam people are spread out over multiple countries - horizontally aligned - and Column people predominately live and work in their home country - vertically aligned.\n\nBeam people are a supranational group that live throughout the world. They have, in many respects, more in common with other people of a similar background across countries and continents than they do with their own compatriots. Most are Western: British with Masters Degrees from American Universities and who now work for Arabian financial institutions in Dubai; Italians with PhDs from Delft University in Holland and who now work for technology start ups in Silicon Valley. However, they are also represented by non Westerners: Turks who have gone to university in Canada and now live in Holland working for Shell; Ghanaians who went to Harvard University and now are Members of Parliament in the UK; Pakistanis who went to Stanford, worked for Citigroup in London and now work for the World Bank in Washington DC.\n\nBeam people predominantly work in the non physical service sector. They include bankers, equity traders, lawyers, engineers, management consultants, accountants, scientists, actors, artists, musicians and the media. They all speak English, in addition to their mother tongue. They have similar work ethics, attitudes to education and moral values. They may be married to a childhood sweetheart from their home country, but will frequently be married to partners of a different nationality. Sometimes neither partner will be a native English speaker but their common language will be English. They will wave their national flag at sporting events like the World Cup or the Olympics but they no longer really feel strong ties to their home country; they would be happy living and working in most parts of the world. While they may consider retiring back in their home country, to be closer to family, they might equally chose to retire somewhere else, with better weather and cheaper wine. They are happy with, and benefit from, the concept of free trade, for people, goods and services, and they are also supporters of large supranational organisations like the EU, UN and WTO, which all impact on the sovereignty of nations. They worry about how to avoid double taxation and how to reduce their taxes in general to countries that they feel little connection, or loyalty, to.\n\nThere is nothing new about Beam people: the Marquis de Lafayette, who was a major supporter and actor in the American Revolution, was a Beam person, as was Thomas Jefferson, who found himself hosting revolutionary parties with Lafayette in Paris in 1789.\n\nColumn people's lives and outlooks are more restricted to their home countries, mainly due to the type of work, or non work, that they do, which is predominantly linked to a physical place. There is a socio-economic hierarchy to those that live in Columns, in contrast to a greater level of social equality for those who live a Beam type of existence.\n\nAt the bottom are those that have no job or who are semi employed. They are net beneficiaries of taxes paid by the rest of society, including the supranational Beam people who pay local taxes. Many are stuck, due to family ties and history, to particular locations where there may be few job opportunities. Once, a generation or two before, those locations might have had thriving economies based on primary resources like coal or iron mining, or secondary industries like steel or manufacturing.\n\nAnother chunk of society is involved in specialist manufacturing, potentially for export, as a large percentage of mass manufacturing is now located in the non West. A minority will work in what mass manufacturing there is left, like in the auto sector, but their employers might not be local companies, but foreign companies that have set up manufacturing plants to deal with the region - BMW and Nissan in the UK, for example.\n\nA very large part of the Column population have jobs linked to government funding. This ranges from those who are directly employed by the government and who work in education, health care, the military and the civil service, to those who are indirectly employed by the government, such as those involved in public infrastructure and all of the companies that provide goods and services to the education, heath, military and civil services. In many parts of the UK outside London and the south east, 70-90% of all employment is linked to government spending.\n\nA small, but vocal, number are involved in agriculture. Agriculture in the European Union is split between very large, highly productive, intensive farms with thousands of acres, that could possibly compete internationally, and smaller farms that produce food but are primarily guardians of an idealised landscape, for which they receive significant subsidies. In the UK, for example, 53% of farm income is in the form of subsidy. Without the subsidy they would not be able to survive in their current form.\n\nAt the very top are the very wealthy. They may have strong international connections, and thus could be part of the Beam social network, but by their very nature may have started to accumulate so much wealth that it is concentrated in one country in particular. They are particularly concerned about things that could curtail their influence and power in their home country and so are particularly against supra national organisations that could impinge on national sovereignty. They are major donors to political parties and individual politicians and frequently will donate to both candidates in a two party system to ensure their views are heard whichever the outcome of an election. They are also wealthy enough with enough fingers in enough pies not to worry about being a loser in free trade agreements.\n\nAs we have seen from the Brexit vote and the rise of Trump in the US, there is a fundamental difference between those who live in the Beam part of society versus those who live in the Column part of society. Column people's opportunities are predominantly tied to their home countries. Beam people have far greater flexibility; they can either work in different countries or can easily provide services to companies or governments located outside their home countries. As a result of this difference, Beam people routinely undermine the competitiveness of their home countries, which has a disproportionate impact on Column people.\n\nBack to the Point\n\nHinkley Point was conceived by Beam people. In their minds it all makes a lot of sense. The UK needs more base load power that does not produce direct carbon emissions and is not intermittent in its production. That rules out coal and gas power stations from the perspective of carbon emissions and rules out renewables from the perspective of intermittency. Enter Nuclear.\n\nWhen Hinkley Point was presented as an option the price looked more reasonable and the technology appeared more reliable. As time has moved on the price has more than doubled and the technology looks increasingly risky. In the meantime the price of renewable energy has plummeted thanks to the early subsidies that allowed it to compete against established forms of power such as coal, natural gas and nuclear. In sunnier parts of the world solar power is already the cheapest form of electricity on the grid. Solar and wind are now significantly cheaper and less risky than nuclear. That is why Hinkley Point has received such lavish subsidy levels: despite the fact that nuclear power has operated on a commercial basis for over 50 years it is now too expensive and too risky for the private sector. The irony.\n\nBeam people will all make good money out of Hinkley Point. Politicians may end up being directors of companies involved in the construction; engineers will have over ten years of construction work and a whole career ahead of them operating the plant. Specialist factories in France will make complex components. Financiers will make huge fees as will the lawyers and accountants who have provided advice to the project.\n\nMany Column people will benefit: they will dig the trenches, pour the concrete and weld the steel. There will be jobs for years too.\n\nAnd yet there is a niggle. Ultimately it is Column people who are going to be paying for Hinkley Point via their taxes and loss of benefits from those taxes. They will be paying for a plant that is being given more than twice the amount of subsidies as renewables are given today for over twice the amount of time. In ten years time, which is how long Hinkley will take to build, assuming no delays, it is likely that renewables will require no subsidies in the UK at all and battery technology will be able to provide the storage capacity to fix the intermittency issue associated with renewables. But for another 35 years after that British tax payers will continue to pay for huge subsidies to be sent to France and China. Those funds could have been used for schools, hospitals, pensions and other things that benefit the majority of the Column population.\n\nBeam people know this. They are well educated and informed. They are doing something that is in their best short term interest but is not in the best interest of their country and their fellow citizens in the long run.\n\nColumn people are not stupid either. Trump's improbable rise and the UK's crazy decision to leave the EU happened because of a growing feeling amongst Column people that the system is rigged against them. Hinkley is just another reminder that they are right.\n\nColumn people need to behave in a more responsible manner - it is ultimately in their best interest too.",

Wars were frequent. Cities and entire territories exchanged sides on a regular basis. Plagues struck both empires, wiping between a third and a half of their populations, leaving both weak and desperate for manpower and allies.\n\nOne willing group of allies for both sides were the tribes of the Arabian peninsula. Both the Romans and the Persians trained them, armed them, pointed them in the direction of their enemies and paid them to fight. Over the decades the Arabs developed a significant military capability and knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.\n\nThis use of allies was not unusual. One of the reasons for the strength and endurance of the Roman Empire was its use of auxiliaries - native soldiers who fought either using their traditional specialties or in Romanised fashion. Many of these auxiliaries units were posted outside their home territories to avoid possible conflicts of interest.\n\nArab auxiliaries, however, followed in the footsteps of other auxiliary groups who got the better of their Roman masters. The Western Roman Empire made use of Huns and Germanic tribes. Alaric, the leader of the Visigoths, had worked on behalf of the Roman Empire. He turned on them and sacked Rome in 410AD. Even the Huns had been used by the Romans, before they succumbed to temptation and attacked their former masters.\n\nUnited by the religious movement founded by the Prophet Mohammad, the Arabs turned on their former paymasters and defeated the Romans in the battle of Yarmuk in 636 and crushed them. Six years later Egypt, Syria and Palestine were all under Arab rule, snatched from their Roman rulers. The Arabs also attacked their Persians paymasters and wiped out the remnants of the Persian army by 642 and the last Persian emperor died in 651AD. The Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) would hobble on for an astounding 800 more years before Constantinople finally fell to the Turks, kicking off the Age of Exploration and colonisation by western Europeans in the Americas, Africa and Asia.\n\nOne of the key lessons from the experience of the Western Roman Empire, Eastern Roman Empire and Persia is that it makes sense to leverage the military assets and capabilities of client states so long as you remain much bigger and more powerful. When you rely on allies who are only a little less powerful, or are your equals in a particular geographic area, bad things start to happen.\n\nWhilst you could immediately start to think of geopolitical parallels today, our focus is on strategic industries, such as aerospace and trains.\n\nGermany and France, through its Airbus interest, and the US, through its Boeing interest, have long dominated the global aerospace sector for passenger aircraft. Over the past two decades they expanded the reach of their supply chains to include a number of other countries, such as Japan.\n\nThis has helped them to secure sales in those countries and has enabled them to spread the risks. Likewise, Germany, France and Japan have dominated the high-speed rail sector through interests in ICE, TGV and the Shinkansen.\n\nThese countries were the Roman and Persian Empire equivalents of their industries. They were dominant and confident enough in their technical and commercial superiority to allow smaller countries and smaller companies to share in the development of sub components for their machines, similar to a Roman ally or auxiliary.\n\nBy the late 1990s and early 2000s China looked like another ally or auxiliary country. Its industrial base was relatively small and its technical prowess was relatively low, confined to low value products. In the high tech battle between the US and Europe, bringing in smart Chinese workers at a fraction of the cost of your own people would enable you to compete better against your European or American competitors.\n\nAnd like the Romans and Persians trained, armed and paid their Arab auxiliaries to fight against Romans or Persians, Europeans and Americans have done the same with the Chinese: Chinese companies helped European companies beat American companies; Chinese companies helped American companies beat European companies.\n\nIn 2007, China's first high speed commercial railway line was introduced. Based on imported trains and trains manufactured in China under technology transfer agreements with foreign train makers, including Alstom (France) Siemens (Germany), Bombardier Transportation (Germany) and Kawasaki Heavy Industries (Japan). Today most of the trains and their subcomponents are manufactured in China, by Chinese companies. Many of the foreign train manufacturers are suing their Chinese technology transfer partners for patent theft. When California announced its plans for a high-speed rail network some of the strongest bids came from Chinese companies, backed by low cost Chinese government financing. These companies had literally not existed a few years before.\n\nChina is also moving into the aerospace sector with similar speed. Comac, for example, was founded in 2008 and has developed its ARJ21 a wide body long range aircraft in cooperation with Bombardier (Canadian branch) and others. It will compete directly with Boeing and Airbus.\n\nAs with the Arabs in the late 500s and early 600s China today is doing what is right for China and doing it very well. The Romans and Persians did not expect that the Arab tribesmen that they were arming to fight their enemies would end up with a politically coherent leadership and defeat them militarily and culturally. They did not expect the devastating plagues that would leave them weakened and unmanned. They almost had an excuse for their policies.\n\nBut China is a huge country in terms of landmass and even larger in terms of population. It has a long and fabulous recorded history and has dominated its end of the Eurasian continent for hundreds of years. Its people are hard working, inventive and determined to restore China to its former greatness. Its leadership thinks in 5 to 50 year time horizons. They can make things on a scale that is impossible in other countries.\n\nIn contrast, American, Japanese and European companies handing over core technology for a short term sale to China seems spectacularly stupid, irresponsible and short sighted. This is not just an issue about corporate myopia. It is an issue caused by a fundamental lack of understanding of how the West became successful in the first place, and of how a successful historical past is no guarantee of a successful historical future.\n\nWhat Happens When China Becomes The Largest Economy In The World?",

If you are familiar forgive me for the short background to the main thrust of this article. And a refresher is never bad either. Read on.\n\nThe dual history of North African and Southern Europe - 650BC - 698AD\n\nAlmost a thousand years before Christ, much of North Africa was dominated by a sea faring Semitic tribe, the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians came from a city called Tyre, now situated in modern day Lebanon. In 650 BC one of the Phoenician colonies, Carthage, gained independence from the mother city-state and started to dominate other Phoenician settlements around the Mediterranean. By 264 BC, most of North Africa west of Egypt, southern Spain, parts of Sicily, all of Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands (Majorca and Minorca) were under their rule. Conflict with the Greeks in Sicily (the famous Archimedes, for example, came from the Greek city of Syracuse in eastern Sicily) and then with the Romans in the Punic Wars ultimately saw the end of the Carthaginian Empire in 146BC. Thereafter, the whole area became part of the Roman Republic and then part of the Roman Empire for over half a millennia.\n\nMany of the greatest cities of the Roman Empire, such as Carthage, Hippo (where St Augustine came from) and Leptis Magna were in North Africa. It was a rich area with excellent agriculture. The long stretch of the Sahara desert to the south provided an impassable barrier that made an effective military defense. These cities were significant net tax contributors to the coffers of the Roman state. This was in sharp contrast to the northern boundary of the Roman Empire, which had poor soils and was constantly being attacked. The area around modern day Tunis was extremely fertile and, along with Egypt later on, became the breadbasket of the Roman Empire. Much needed grain was shipped to the city of Rome, where it was handed out free to its citizens, which ensured its dominance in the Empire.\n\nFrom the third century AD the Roman Empire was increasingly battered by German tribes on its northern border. In response the Romans first created buffer states of German tribes, whose loyalty they managed by a mixture of favouritism and the occasional war. These tribes were used to fend off other German tribes even further north. One German tribe, which has direct relevance to North Africa, was called the Vandals. They are believed to have come from an area around modern day Poland, and possibly from Sweden before that. The name \"Vandal\" might simply mean Wanderer.\n\nAround 400 AD, the Vandals, perhaps pushed by the Huns, moved into Roman Gaul. By 409 they along with a number of other German tribes crossed the Pyrenees into what is now Spain. After attempts to settle in Spain failed, they continued south and a large group of Vandals crossed over into North Africa in 429AD. By 439 AD they captured the prize of North Africa, Carthage, without a fight. They then took over many of the old Carthaginian lands of Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica and the Balearic Islands. With a navy they then raided the coast of Italy and even sacked Rome: which is why their name is now synonymous with destruction. The loss of North Africa helped to kill off the Roman Empire in the west as the loss of grain shipments and tax revenues made life in Rome almost impossible.\n\nRepeated attempts to reconquer North Africa failed until finally, in 534, a force from the Eastern Roman Empire, what we now call Byzantium, defeated the Vandals. Most of its men were killed or recruited into the Roman army. The Eastern Roman Empire turned Africa back into a prefecture, with its capital in Carthage. It also added Sardinia, Corsica and the Balearic Islands to the prefecture.\n\nThis respite for North Africa was to be short lived. From the mid 600s the population of Carthage started to swell with refugees fleeing across the Libyan desert from Egypt. The invasions of the Muslims had begun. After the death of Mohammed in 632AD, Muslim fighters, who had been trained and armed by both the Romans and the Persians during the long war between those two powers, turned on both their Roman and Persian paymasters . A decade later they finished off the Persian Empire. In 647AD they turned on Roman North Africa, first with attacks in Egypt and then on North Africa itself. In 698 Roman Carthage was crushed by a force of 40,000 Muslims. By 709 all of North Africa was under Muslim control and in 711 a small force crossed over the Mediterranean Sea and landed at Gibraltar. By 720 all of Spain up to the Pyrenees, with the exception of Asturias, had been taken over by Muslim forces.\n\nThe dual history of North African and historical differences with Southern Europe, 698AD - Today\n\nAfter the conquest of North Africa and Spain by Muslim forces, the historical and cultural trajectory of North Africa and Southern Europe started to diverge.\n\nSpain, or Hispania, was renamed Al-Andalus, which may be a corruption of Vandalusia, or the land of the Vandals. The territory was carved into eight administrative units: Andalusia, Galicia, Portugal, Castile, Leon, Aragon, Catalonia and Septimania (what is now southern France). Asturias, to the far north, remained outside Muslim rule and was critical to Spanish history as it formed the basis of the gradual Christian re-conquest of Spain. By 1200 only half of the Iberian Peninsula remained under Muslim control and by the mid century only the Emirate of Granada remained, until 1492 when that was also wiped out, bringing the whole of the Iberian Peninsula back under Christian control.\n\nNorth African dominance by the Muslim world was more permanent but not without its ups and downs. In the early 740s the Berbers, the native population of the area who were by now a mix of African tribesmen, Carthaginians, Romans, Greeks and slaves from all over the known world, rose up in revolt against their Muslim rulers. Thereafter, Muslim control over North Africa from far away Damascus and Baghdad became almost impossible and a series of local dynasties were set up.\n\nThe first great dynasty was the Fatimid dynasty from AD 909-1171. First, the Fatimids headed east and conquered Egypt. There they created a new capital city on the Nile called \" the Victorious\" - Al Kahira - which we call Cairo in English. In the meantime, from AD 1062 - 1147 the Almoravids took over the northwest of Africa, centered on Marrakech. The Almoravids entered Spain in 1086, on the request of Spanish Muslims who had been suffering defeats by the Spanish Christians. Their advance into Spain was stopped at Valencia by the famous Spanish warrior, El Cid.\n\nThe Almoravids were, in turn, defeated by another Berber Muslim group - the Almohads. By 1159 the Almohads ruled all of northern Africa as far as Benghazi to the east and also ruled southern Spain. Their decline in Spain began rapidly after the combined Christian armies of Castile, Aragon, Navarre and Portugal fell upon Cordoba and then Seville in 1236 and 1248. Berber tribes in North Africa declared themselves independent and another group, the Marinids, captured Fes and then Marrakech in 1269. Marinid rule continued until the 15th century when they also fell.\n\nAs we move into the early modern period things begin to get more familiar. The Berbers were by this stage also know as the Barbars and the area in which they lived became known as the Barbary Coast. From the early 1500s the Turks, who had recently defeated the remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire in Byzantium, come to dominate the eastern part of the Mediterranean. The Turks were in conflict with Spain over much of North Africa. The Turks sponsored pirates - corsairs - to fight the Spanish, in the same way that the English sponsored privateers to attack Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. The Turks were remarkably successful in disrupting the Spanish, but their strategy also left North Africa without a strong political center.\n\nIn 1830 the French, fed up with the ongoing Barbary piracy, invaded Algeria. Tunisia became a French protectorate in 1881, Morocco became a Spanish and French protectorate in 1912 and Italy took Libya from the Turks in the same year. Egypt, in the meantime, spent much of the 19th Century under British control. Britain was determined to protect the Suez canal that had opened in 1869. Independence came to North Africa over the course of the 20th Century. Egypt gained independence in 1922, Libya in 1951, Tunisia and Morocco in 1956 and Algeria in 1962.\n\nHistorical recap\n\nSo what does this 20,000 ft?? overview of North African history tell us? Firstly, from 650BC to 698AD - 1,348 years - North Africa with its Carthaginian, Roman, Christian and Germanic heritage, was a land that was culturally very similar to what could be found on the northern side of Mediterranean. It had, in fact, a historical background that was almost identical to that of Spain.\n\nThen, with the arrival of Islam, which combined the sword with the word of God, North Africa switched from being a rather rich demilitarised zone into one that was aggressive militarily for over 500 years, invading Western Europe all the way into southern France.\n\nAfter that, for the next 700 years, the area was on the back foot, being pushed out of Spain completely by 1492. North Africa descended into anarchic pirate kingdoms for over 300 years before the Europeans, mainly French, Spanish, Italian and the British, took them over as colonies or protectorates.\n\nNorth Africa today\n\nToday, much of North Africa is in trouble. It is not the rich land of the Carthaginians, exporting its huge food surpluses to southern Europe. It is not the aggressive land of the early Muslim conquerors, bringing Islam into Western Europe. It is not even part of the European Union: had they not achieved independence as early as they did then they might have had access to, or become part of, the European Union.\n\nMorocco is a constitutional monarchy. The country has a Mediterranean climate in the north, where most of the agriculture takes place, but most of the country is desert. There are 32 million Moroccans in Morocco, 1 million in France, 700,000 in Spain and over 360,000 in Belgium and 300,000 in the Netherlands. There were 11.6 million Moroccans in 1960. The GDP per capita in 2011 was $3,083. Most are Sunnis of Berber extraction.\n\nAlgeria is a republic. It is the largest country in Africa and derives most of its budget and 95 % of foreign earnings from oil and gas. Its soils are pretty fertile from the coast to the Atlas Mountains in the south. Beyond the mountains are huge steppe lands and the Sahara desert. The population was 35 million in 2011, up from 10.8 million people in 1960. Thanks to oil revenues, its GDP per capita in 2011 was higher than that of Morocco, at $5,304. Most Algerians are Sunnis of Berber extraction.\n\nTunisia has just had a revolution. It is the smallest of the North African countries and shares a similar climate to Morocco and Algeria. There are 10.7 million Tunisians, up from 4.2 million in 1960. The 2011 GDP per capita was $4,351, which is what it probably should have been in the absence of any revolution. Most Tunisians are Sunnis of Berber extraction.\n\nLibya has also just come out of a revolution. It is primarily desert and historically acted as a buffer zone between Egypt and the rest of North Africa. There is a thin strip of Mediterranean climate on the coast that sustains some agriculture but 75% of all food is imported. The population of Libya was 6.4 million in 2011, up from 1.4 million in 1960. The GDP per capita in 2011 was estimated to have been $5,691, which is probably what it should have been in the absence of any revolution. The bulk of Libya's economy is based on the oil sector. Most Libyans are Sunnis of Berber extraction.\n\nEgypt is the biggest country of North Africa in terms of population and has also just come out of a revolution. It is primarily desert, but has the River Nile running through it, which has brought the country economic prosperity since before the time of the Pharaohs. The population of Egypt was 83 million in 2011, up from 28 million in 1960. The country is poor, with a GDP per capita of 2011 of $3,118. Most of the country is made up of Egyptians at 91% of the population with Berbers, Arabs, Turks and Greeks making up the remainder. Most are Sunni Muslims.\n\nSo what do all of these countries have in common today?\n\n- First, they are predominantly Berbers who share the Sunni form of Islam, along with most Saudis.\n\nFirst, they are predominantly Berbers who share the Sunni form of Islam, along with most Saudis.\n\n- Second, they are all relatively poor, with GDP per capita ranging from $3,000 to $5,700 per annum.\n\nSecond, they are all relatively poor, with GDP per capita ranging from $3,000 to $5,700 per annum.\n\n- Third, they all have very little agricultural land.

As their populations increase their ability to feed themselves by imported food declines as competition for jobs puts downwards pressure on incomes.\n\nTheir shared Sunni faith with Saudi Arabia means that Islamic radicalisation through Saudi funded Wahhabi sect schools in their countries is more likely.\n\nThis region has had a cultural history of resentment against the West, fostered by their recent colonisation. Collectively they have a long history of aggressive Islamic militarism which includes the successful invasions and occupations of Spain, France, Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands.\n\nThe North African Threat to the European Union\n\nAt some point population growth, land degradation and their inability to feed themselves properly will hit a crunch point . North Africa will then face a major issue: how do they ensure enough food and jobs for their people? If their economies do not grow sufficiently they will not be able to pay for food imports. There are millions of their fellow citizens already living in the European Union. Many will try to use those family connections to emigrate. But at some point the European Union citizens will say enough is enough.\n\nHowever, that does not make the problem go away.\n\nYou can then expect two things to occur.\n\nFirst, there will be pressure from North African residents of Europe on European governments to allow more North African migrants in. Some of this pressure will be political. If North Africans organised themselves they would discover that their numbers are probably sufficient to act as a swing political party in many European Union governments, especially those that are fractured by coalition governments. In return for policies allowing more immigration into France, Spain, Belgium and Holland where their numbers are already high they could help local politicians form a government. Given what we know about how political parties operate, it is highly likely that political parties on the verge of winning a mandate would align themselves to these North African groups in order tip them over the edge and thus gain power.\n\nSome pressure will be violent. Given Islam's ability to gather sufficient recruits for suicide bombings without an existential threat, it is highly plausible that North African riots in countries like France would be likely. After all, their family members are starving: this is an existential threat. These pressures could precipitate in the fall of democratically elected governments in the European Union. At that point it is hard to guess whether a new government would be pro North Africa or anti North Africa.\n\nSecond, there will be pressure from North Africans (and sub Saharan Africans who face similar issues) fleeing across into Spain, Malta, Corsica, Sardinia, the Balearics, Sicily and Italy by boat. This would impose a moral nightmare for European Union governments. If the boat people were unarmed, they would be considered civilians and would get protection under international law. If they landed on European Union soil they would be granted asylum. If the boat people had weapons they would be considered military targets and thus the boats could be sunk.\n\nSo the European Union navies would have to try to stop the boat people from reaching the shores of European Union territories. Crashing navy vessels into heavily laden ships carrying women and children might result in the sinking of the boat, potentially killing all on board. If the boats were stopped by shooting out the engines the boats could drift, ending up killing all on board due to exposure and lack of food and water. In short, doing anything to the boats could result in many people losing their lives.\n\nIf this happened on a large enough scale (because it does happen already on a minor scale), you could expect the governments of North Africa to intervene, potentially sparking a military crisis. This would be relatively easy for the European Union to deal with as any North African naval vessels would then become legitimate military targets. But if this crisis were to be triggered it is guaranteed that the North Africans already resident in the European Union would switch from aggressive rioting and the occasional suicide bombing into something far, far worse. They are not going to accept the killing of their family members.\n\nNone of this is a particularly pretty picture and the endgame could be more horrific or more benign. What should be clear, however, is that what is happening in North Africa today represents a real threat to the European Union. The demographic trends are unstoppable and thus so too is the problem. We would need a miracle to fix the problem.\n\nMediterranean Reunification, or the search of a miracle\n\nFortunately, History Future Now has such a miracle in mind. The solution is to make North Africa part of the European Union. Here are some details.\n\nIn a previous article , History Future Now wrote about the virtues of regional free trade, rather than global free trade. The argument was that global free trade resulted in a race to the bottom in terms of salaries, worker and environmental protections. Richer economies are being hollowed out and the benefit of cheaper products for those with jobs is not sufficient to offset the loss of social cohesion and the cost of paying for those without jobs.\n\nEuropean Union would put up trade barriers on all products imported into the European Union so as to make the cost difference between an EU product and a non EU product the same. The imported products would also need to conform to similar environmental and labour standards as products produced within the EU. Ideally, this would mean that imports of goods produced outside the European Union with a competitive advantage that stems from cheap labour and lax environmental standards would be halted.\n\nIn our scenario, North Africa would become part of a European Union Free Trade region. Its products would be allowed into the European Union without tariff barriers, subject to production conforming to minimum environmental and workers standards, similar to trade within the European Union today. They would, however, be able to compete due to cheaper labour than in the European Union.\n\nWhat would this mean? Firstly, North Africa would be a magnet for companies that wanted to sell products into the European Union. They would be incentivised to set up factories, distribution centers and service centers. The manufacture of many products would be possible due to lower costs of labour. This strategy would help to create jobs in North Africa, help to stabilise their economies and to give them a stake in keeping the peace.\n\nWith more income, North Africa would be able to afford to import more food and to modernise its own agriculture, ultimately making it more efficient by harnessing advanced irrigation techniques, for example.\n\nAs for the European Union, this should not result in a sudden loss of jobs to North Africa. Many of the products that we are currently buying from China and other parts of the world would be substituted by products being produced in North Africa instead. With increased stability in North Africa and increased trade across the Mediterranean Sea, it would also make sense to finally embrace DESERTEC, a scheme to create concentrated solar power in the deserts of North Africa to provide reliable low cost electric power to the European Union via high voltage sub sea cables. This project would provide jobs in North Africa and could provide all of Europe's electrical power needs.\n\nThere would be strings attached. Study after study shows that educating women results in lower levels of fertility. If the European Union helped provide funding for education it would reduce the need for funding of education from Saudi Arabia, reducing extremist forms of Islam. This education would respect their Islamic heritage without encouraging the unnecessary form of Islam that is actively hostile to the West. This action would help defuse the demographic time bomb of North Africa. In addition, North Africans would not automatically get the freedom to emigrate to the EU. Without the economic impetus to do so, many would not want to anyway.\n\nAnd finally, while this solution helps to solve some very real threats, there is something exciting about reunifying the Mediterranean countries after over a thousand years of strife. For 1,385 years we shared a common cultural, historical, linguistic and religious heritage. North Africa was more integral to the Roman Empire than Britain or Gaul.\n\nSo encourage your local politicians to stand on a platform of Mediterranean Reunification!\n\nChina Has Many Of The Characteristics Of An Emerging Colonial Power.

None of these explanations are satisfying, many are contradictory and they focus on relatively short term issues.\n\nIn this article History Future Now steps back and looks at 500 years of Western history to see if there is a more satisfying explanation for this decline.\n\nTwo things emerge from this high level view.\n\nFirst, the West is not a homogenous block and its constituent countries have all declined at some point. From a historical perspective there is nothing unusual about the decline of the West.\n\nSecond, it becomes clear that the rise of the West was partially based on luck and, had circumstances been different, may never have happened at all.\n\nTeam West\n\nIf you look at the West as one homogenous group it appears to have maintained its dominance over the world for over 500 years and it now appears to be in decline. However, if you look at it as a series of heterogenous, individual, states you will see a series of distinct rises and falls. Spain rose and fell. Portugal rose and fell. The Netherlands rose and fell. France rose and fell. Britain rose and fell. Germany rose and fell. The United States rose and is falling. In each case the fall of one Western country was overlapped by the rise of another Western country, as though they were all team members in a gigantic relay race against the rest of the world. \"Team West\" has done very well, but the individual members all faltered after a time.\n\nWhat is different today, however, is that the United States is in decline and there is no successor Western state waiting to pick up the baton for \"Team West\".\n\nIf the concept of \"the West\" is broadened so that it is not merely a synonym for fair skinned people of a European Christian heritage and encompasses the broader intellectual concepts of Western science, medicine, law, capitalism and values, then even the rise of China could be seen as another triumph of \"the West\". They could be co-opted into \"Team West\".\n\nWhile Westerners and the Chinese alike will probably be affronted by this concept, for different reasons, this is not too dissimilar to what happened to the Roman Empire from the mid 300s AD onwards. Germanic tribes north of the river Danube began to invade the Roman Empire and settle within its borders. What the fairer skinned Germans all had in common was a desire to be part of the darker skinned Roman Empire. They did not invade to destroy it, but rather they envied its wealth and culture and wanted to be a part of it. They stopped using their Germanic languages, wrote in Latin, used Roman law and promoted Rome's official religion: Christianity. Over time the German tribes that invaded what is now France, Spain, Portugal and Italy would end up speaking the Latin based languages that morphed into French, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese and Italian. Even as late as 800 AD the German ruler of much of Western Europe, Charlemagne (Charles the Great) had himself crowned as the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nSo when looking at the decline of the West it is important to remember that most of the major Western powers have been through their own rises and falls already. Decline is normal, from a historical perspective.\n\nA more interesting question is how did \"Team West\" rise in the first place?\n\nThe Age of Luck\n\nThe second reason for this apparent decline is that the rise of the West was as a result of a series of incredibly lucky breaks, none of which were inevitable at all. This luck has run out.\n\nWe are going to look at the rise and fall of three great Western powers over the past 500 years: Spain, Britain and the United States. Portugal, the Netherlands, France and Germany were all great powers for a while but ultimately they lacked the scope and success of Spain, Britain and the United States and so will only be mentioned in passing. Clearly, Rome had dominated the Mediterranean region from 100BC to 450AD or so. There were other great powers in Europe in the past as well. But all of these powers were essentially regional. They controlled two to three million square miles of territory at their maximum extent. What was new was the huge extent of global territory controlled by a few Western countries.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Spain\n\nPrior to the mid 1400s there was little evidence to suggest that the West would soon dominate the world.\n\nBut things were changing. The European states on the the western edge of Eurasia had historically been poorer than those who dominated the central and eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea and the valuable trade routes with Asia. The loss of Constantinople in 1453 to the Ottomans and the victory of the Spaniards over Muslim Spain helped to create a new impetus to find alternative trade routes to bypass the Muslim lock on trade with Asia.\n\nThere were two possible alternative routes to Asia. The first route was to sail south and east around Africa and across the Indian Ocean. Fortunately, by the late 1400s improved cartography, navigation skills, the magnetic compass, triangular sails, and deep water ship design gave the Portuguese the theoretical capacity to cross the Atlantic Ocean. They successfully reached the tip of southern Africa in 1488.\n\nThe second route was to head west, across an uncharted ocean, to China and Japan. This was deemed impossible as it was too far. Christopher Columbus, an Italian from Genoa, was bold enough to insist that this journey was possible and the Spanish monarchy was wealthy enough to support this risky adventure. He was lucky to land on an island thousands of miles away from China, in the Caribbean.\n\nHis safe return back to Spain in 1493 transformed the Atlantic Ocean from being an un-crossable barrier to an easily crossed trade highway for Western Europe. In the same way the Mediterranean Sea was critical for trade within Roman Empire, the Atlantic Ocean became critical for trade for Britain, France, Portugal and Spain.\n\nBut mere trade was not the only lucky break. Diseases such as small pox decimated the population of the Americas, which had been isolated from Eurasian diseases for over 20,000 years when the land route to America over the Bering land bridge from Asia was flooded by the sea. Some historians believe that up to 90% of the population of the Americas was wiped out by disease. So many people died that forests reclaimed vast areas of land once cleared by Indians, sucking up giga-tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, possibly triggering the little ice age in Europe from the mid 1500s.\n\nThis enabled a a few Western countries to dominate and monopolise the Americas in a way that was simply impossible in other parts of the world. European colonies in Africa and Asia remained fundamentally African and Asian, with relatively few white settlers.\n\nSpain was the initial beneficiary of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Firstly they made money from pillaging the Aztec and Inca Empires, bringing back huge quantities of gold and silver. This one-off lucky break was followed up by the discovery of the silver mountain of Potosi in modern day Bolivia. This mountain would provide staggering amounts of silver that was melted down into the silver coins, known as pieces of eight or Spanish dollars, that formed the basis of trade for much of the world economy during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. From the 1560s Spanish ships crossed the Pacific Ocean on regular voyages, taking with them the silver coins that were highly prized by the Chinese.\n\nMeanwhile, Portuguese ships finally managed to get round the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa and began to trade with India, China and Japan directly.\n\nThus the discovery of the Americas gave Spain and Portugal, who had discovered and claimed Brazil whilst trying to get round the Cape of Good Hope, a huge advantage over other historic Eurasian powers.\n\nSpain was lucky. What were the chances that a trading trip west to China would result in the discovery of two entire continents whose populations would be decimated not by war but by European disease? What were the chances that the rapid political collapse of the Aztec and Inca empires would allow a few hundred Spanish fighters to dominate huge empires with millions of people? Or that these territories would produce gold and huge quantities of silver that were the only real commodity desired by the Chinese?\n\nAs a piece of fiction, the likelihood of these events happening is preposterous. The Spanish were at the right place at the right time. They translated this wealth into power and influence in Europe. Spain had the wealth to expand into parts of Italy and Sicily and the Netherlands.\n\nBut their luck would not last forever and they would be eclipsed by the Dutch and the English. By the late 1600s Spain's golden age was over. In 1701, after Charles II of Spain died without an heir, a global war broke out between Europe's major powers and their colonial settlements. After 14 years the War of the Spanish Succession was over. Spain kept much of its overseas empire but its territories in Italy, Sicily, the Southern Netherlands became independent and Gibraltar and Minorca became British possessions.\n\nThe baton of Western dominance passed over from Spain to Britain. But Team West was still in the race.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Britain\n\nEngland also went west to find a sea route to China. In 1495 John Cabot, an Italian from Genoa, arrived in England and persuaded King Henry VII to finance the cost of a crew and a single caravel ship to head west. They landed in what is now Newfoundland in 1497 and claimed North America for the English Crown.\n\nEngland's American colonies were initially a failure. The English had gone to the Americas in search for gold and silver. They found none in their Atlantic colonies. The only people who seemed to be interested in settling there it were religious refugees determined to create a semi-theocratic state in New England.\n\nThose less interested in religion found wealth by turning to privateering: ships that were given official papers from the English Crown allowing them to attack foreign shipping in exchange for a cut of the loot. Nimble English ships robbed heavy Spanish treasure ships crossing from the Spanish Main back to Spain. This was one of the reasons why Catholic Spain tried to invade Protestant England in 1588 with a vast, expensive, fleet of ships. This Armada was destroyed by freak storms and the loss nearly bankrupted Spain. England and Protestantism was saved.\n\nEngland, which would merge with Scotland in 1707 to become Great Britain, would eventually become rich and powerful not thanks to the mining of gold and silver, but by the cultivation of cash crops. In 1655 the English captured Spanish Jamaica and turned it into one of the richest territories in the world, thanks to a combination of climate and African slaves, which allowed the cultivation of sugar cane and coffee: high value crops that were easy to transport.\n\nCoffee, tea, tobacco and sugar are all addictive. In higher latitudes the distinctive seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn help to reduce natural plant predation. In the tropics, where the temperature is relatively similar all year round and plants retain their leaves, insects, bacteria and fungi can feast on plants unchecked. So many plants evolved the ability to produce natural pesticides that either kill or at least repel their attackers. That is why so many tropical plants are poisonous.\n\nCoffee, tea and tobacco all contain natural pesticides. They are sufficiently strong to deter or kill pests, but sufficiently weak so that their poisons act as an addictive stimulant on humans. Coffee and tobacco grew well in the tropical Caribbean islands. Since they were addictive they made the perfect cash crop for English and French landowners who wanted to sell to the European market. But the English and French labourers who moved to the Caribbean to grow these plants died in their thousands, sometimes days after arriving from Europe. Coming from a temperate climate, they had not developed resistance to tropical diseases. Without a viable workforce none of these plants could be cultivated and thus no money could be made.\n\nFortunately for these hopeful European entrepreneurs, the west coast of Africa had a tradition of slavery. When west African rulers defeated their rivals in battle they would enslave the defeated population. The more slaves you had the more powerful you were seen to be. West Africans had developed significantly higher levels of resistance to tropical diseases than their European counterparts. So the Portuguese, and then the English, set up slaving depots along the west African coast. West African rulers would bring captured slaves to the coast and would sell them to the Europeans in exchange for a range of European products.\n\nThe Europeans took the slaves across the Atlantic to work in the fields of the Caribbean. Jamaica would end up with a slave population that was 20 times greater than the white English population that controlled it. Sugar cane was added to the list of addictive crops and the waste molasses would be turned into another addictive substance, rum, which was processed in England's North American colonies. Later it was discovered that cotton could be grown effectively in the southern parts of North America. By that time the slave infrastructure that would enable this plant to be grown and harvested cheaply was already in place.\n\nSpain's empire had primarily been based on the economic exploitation of silver. With silver it could buy pretty much anything that it wanted, making the further development of its economy less important. Portugal's dominance in trade with India, China and Japan was eventually undermined by its enthusiasm for promoting the Catholic faith. When Dutch traders, who had little interest in promoting Protestantism, arrived in Asia they quickly became the favoured trading partners of the ruling elites. This story is not too dissimilar to how China's policy of non-intervention in the internal politics of Africa today gives it a trade advantage over Western countries who are more concerned about human rights than making money.\n\nBritain's Atlantic wealth was more complicated to produce and required the development of a broader range of skills than mining silver. The trade triangle that emerged between Africa, the source of African slaves, the Caribbean (and later America), where cash crops were grown with African slaves and England, where the cash crops were processed and sold to a broad market, allowed England's wealth to be more widely shared. Spain's wealth was converted into lavish baroque buildings and fantastic art for a narrow ruling elite. England's wealth was created by getting as many people as possible addicted to tobacco, coffee, tea, rum and sugar. Processing, sales and marketing were as important as growing the stuff.\n\nDespite the loss of the American colonies in 1783 Britain went into the next century richer than ever before. Britain had deliberately kept its North American colonies under-developed. The production of many manufactured products had been discouraged or was illegal. The transportation of American raw materials was done by British merchant ships and the colonies had been only allowed to trade with Britain. Language, cultural and legal ties kept Britain close to its former American colonies. So when the cotton gin was invented in 1794, enabling the cleaning of cotton on an industrial scale, American cotton would be shipped to Britain where new industrial processes would convert it into high quality, low cost, cloth that would flood the world's markets.\n\nBritain also went about creating a new empire in Africa and in India. During the American War of Independence the Spanish, Dutch and French had sided with the American colonists. Britain defeated them and won number of Spanish, Dutch and French territories and trading posts in India and Central America. Eventually the new British Empire would stretch all the way to China with its colonisation of Hong Kong in 1841.\n\nThe Empire was tied together by a phenomenal navy and merchant marine. Raw materials flowed from all corners of the world into British ports and were transformed into high quality, low cost, manufactured products that were sent out again to the rich of the world. Britain made money from trade. From manufacturing. From investing in global infrastructure projects.\n\nNormal British citizens also did relatively well, once the initial trauma of industrialisation had worn off. Britain had the capital to construct factories in Britain and British workers were hired to work in them. They earned enough money to buy many of the products they produced, creating a middle class that was wealthy enough to create demand for new products. By the mid 1800s London was by far the richest city in the world and Britain continued to dominate the world economically all the way up to the beginning of the First World War.\n\nFundamentally, however, Britain was lucky. The initial failure of its colonies actually helped it in the long run. The lack of gold and silver meant that it needed to develop its colonial economy. The fortuitous trade triangle of additive cash crops, such as tobacco and sugar, African slaves and manufacturing made it the richest country in the world. Even the loss of its thirteen American colonies was shrugged off as it built a new empire over which the sun would never set.\n\nFinally, however, it was the the two World Wars that would be Britain's undoing. Their luck ran out and the baton of Western dominance would be passed over to the United States, who were also incredibly lucky, but for different reasons. Team West was still in the race.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the United States\n\nThe creation of the American Republic, through the uniting of thirteen British colonies was a triumph of English Enlightenment ideals. Oliver Cromwell and the English Parliament had tried repeatedly throughout the Commonwealth period after the execution of Charles I in 1649 to create a permanent republic in Britain. Despite their best efforts they failed and the monarchy was reintroduced shortly after Cromwell's death.\n\nUp until 1776 American colonists were British citizens and all shared the same heritage as those living in Britain itself. As a result, the rise of the United States can be seen as merely the rise of another branch of British society, unlike the transition of power from Catholic Spain to Protestant Britain.\n\nAmerica's rise was based on luck. And that luck was based on two things: North American geography and European wars.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ended the war between Britain and her American colonies, the United States still held less territory in North America than Spain and Great Britain. The newly United States of America were hemmed in between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coast. To the north was British North America (Canada), which was ruled directly by the British Crown and to the west were Indian territories that were allied to Great Britain and nominally under Crown rule. Most of rest of North America was owned by Spain, which controlled all of modern day Mexico and most of the Pacific coast all the way up to Alaska. They also controlled Florida, to the south.\n\nHad America been stuck within those borders it would never have become a global power, with the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans providing it with a gigantic moat to defend itself against attackers and an enormous temperate continental landmass to expand into.\n\nThe young United States needed to break out from its constraints. It was greatly assisted in this by the British who betrayed their American Indian allies during the Paris peace treaty negotiations in 1783 and ceded to the US control over what was referred to as the Northwest Territory - an amalgamation of Indian lands to the east of the Mississippi in what is now mainly Ohio and Michigan. The Americans eagerly moved into this territory, despite Indian resistance. This more than doubled the size of the area of the original thirteen colonies and started to shift the colonies attention away from the Atlantic Ocean towards developing a continental empire.\n\nThe next big step took place between 1800 and 1803 when the United States doubled in size, once again, without firing a shot. After the Seven Years War, which ended in 1763, France seceded its French colony of Louisiana to Spain. In 1800 a new secret treaty between France and Spain gave Louisiana back to France in exchange for France handing over parts of Italy to the Spanish king. Napoleon Bonaparte sent a vast and expensive military expedition to Louisiana to regain control of Louisiana and the French island of Saint Dominigue (now Haiti) which had been overrun by a slave rebellion. Saint Dominigue, like Jamaica, was a source of tremendous wealth for France. The French were unable to retake the island. A third of the soldiers died due to disease, including its commander. Napoleon gave up on the Americas and sold the Louisiana territory, which hadn't really been part of France for 40 years, to the United States for $15 million dollars.\n\nControl over Louisiana gave the United States control over New Orleans. Control over New Orleans gave the United States control over the Mississippi river valley, which was the only way for bulk goods to be transported out of the lands west of the Appalachian mountain range. Interestingly, Napoleon could have sold Louisiana back to the Spanish, but chose not to. He hated the weak Spanish king and his chief advisor (who was sleeping with the Spanish queen) and giving the land to the United States was likely to cause problems for both Britain and Spain in the future. Since Napoleon had decided to embark on a campaign of European expansion, this was definitely a positive spin on what had been a disastrous result for France in the Americas. This was one of the great \"what ifs\" in history. What would have happened had the slave rebellion not occurred at the time and had Napoleon been successful in re-establishing a thriving French presence in North America?\n\nAmerica's borders remained pretty much intact until the Treaty of 1818 established the 49th parallel as the border between the British North America (Canada) and the United States. Oregon became a shared territory, giving the United States territorial access to the Pacific for the first time. In 1819 Florida and part of Colorado were added to the United States. In the meantime, Russia had established a colony in what is now Alaska. In 1824 the Spanish Empire in North America collapsed and a new country, Mexico, took its place. Texas separated itself from Mexico in 1836 and became independent.\n\nThe next big step took place between 1845, when Texas joined the United States, and in 1848, when the war between Mexico and the United States ended, bringing in California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona and parts of Colorado, New Mexico and Wycoming over to the United States. With the exception of Alaska, bought from Russia in 1867, and more nibbling away at the borders of Canada and Mexico, the external borders of the continental United States were complete.\n\nIn 1861, however, America's luck faltered and seemed to run out. Vexed over the question of the expansion of slavery into all of the new territories acquired by the United States, the southern states seceded from the Union and became the Confederate States of America.\n\nThis was a major crossroads for the country, a mere 78 years after it had been formed. Had the split remained permanent there would have been five powers in North America: Mexico, the Confederate States of America, the rump United States of America, British North America (Canada) and Russia (Alaska). Instead, the northern rump of the United States invaded the south, determined to keep the union whole. With the North American continent thus divided it is highly unlikely that the United States would have developed into the economic giant that it would become and would certainly not have been in any position to assist in either the First or Second World War.\n\nWhich brings us to the next great piece of luck for the United States: European wars.\n\nOver the past 500 years not a single century has passed without a major European conflict. But the First World War was particularly devastating. It was the first time that fully industrialised nations had fought each other. Millions of young Europeans were left dead and maimed. Initially isolationist, America joined the war in 1917, three years after it had started, and while their contribution was modest their involvement helped to convince German officers that German defeat was inevitable.\n\nThe Great War was a disaster for Britain. Apart from the obvious horrific human losses, it had racked up enormous debts to pay for victory. President Wilson's call for self government for all peoples ushered in an independence frenzy and great powers like the Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman Empires ceased to exist. This same call for self government gave birth to a generation of revolutionaries that would grow up calling for resistance against British rule in Britain's far flung colonies. During the interwar period it lost control over Canada, Australia and New Zealand. India and most of its African colonies would be lost after the end of the Second World War.\n\nIt was the Second World War, however, that was of the greatest benefit to the United States and made it the most powerful country in the world. To the detriment of Britain.\n\nAs with the First World War, America arrived late and suffered far fewer casualties than the other main participants of the Second World War. Russian, German and Japanese losses were huge. French casualties, due to a quick exit, were relatively light and British casualties, due to being excluded from the continental war until the arrival of the Americans, were also relatively light.\n\nWhen the US first joined the war, over two years after it had started in Europe, Britain was the dominant ally. Within a year the balance of power had shifted, permanently. Britain had been borrowing heavily from the United States prior to the US entry into the war. By the end of the war Britain was broke and its major cities had been devastated. Britain's last Second World War loan repayment to the US was made in 2006. Parts of France, Belgium and Holland had been destroyed. Many major German cities had been scoured off the face of the Earth. Poland, Austria, Hungary, the Ukraine and parts of Russia and been equally destroyed. Japan had been devastated. European nations shed their former colonial possessions after the war.\n\nSo when the war ended America was the only major industrial power that had not seen its physical infrastructure destroyed by the war. All of its commercial rivals were in ruins and were bankrupt. Thousands of Europe's most talented scientists had fled to the US in the run up to the Second World War and after the war. The Manhattan Project was dominated by German, Danish, Italian and Austrian scientists, many of whom were Jews who had fled Nazi persecution, and was based off European scientific breakthroughs in physics and chemistry. The US and Soviet space programme was dominated by German scientists and engineers and based off the German V2 rocket programme. American post war jet engines were based on German Luftwaffe designs.\n\nDuring the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s the US enjoyed a golden age where its products were sold throughout the world. Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics, once dominated by Europeans, started to be won in the US. European Jews, who had boosted Europe's scientific and cultural outputs, became American Jews and would come to dominate American media, finance and science. US also enjoyed tremendous levels of income equality. One man employed in a factory could support a family of five or six. Strong unions kept worker's wages high. They could do this because the US had no real competitors. Everybody didn't just want US products. They needed US products.\n\nSo the US had been very lucky. The Lousianna Purchase from France had allowed it to double in size and the collapse of the Spanish Empire had allowed it to take over former Spanish territories in the south and west. With an entire continent to colonise America had a critical mass of land in a temperate climate with few external enemies to challenge its supremacy. Two destructive Europe-centric conflicts, the First World War and then, most importantly, the Second World War, had destroyed America's industrial competitors and had enabled it to capture new markets as Europeans shed their colonies. Nazi persecution of European Jews gave it, not Germany, the atomic bomb.\n\nBut then, by the 1970s, America's luck began to run out and its started its slow decline. The war dividend was over. Germany and Japan had gone through a period of high growth as they rebuilt their cities and their factories. Fearful of their militaristic past they focused on conquering foreign markets through products, not by means of war. London reclaimed its position as the centre of global finance. American manufacturers, who had been able to produce high volume-low quality products for years suddenly found themselves on the back foot as companies like VW and Toyota started to sell high quality, low cost products not just in their home markets but also in the US. One American market after another was taken over by foreign companies. Workers were laid off and unions could not help. Unions could get away with fighting for high wages and job security when there were no foreign competitors. A union vote for high wages and job security in a world full of cheaper, better competitors was a vote for corporate suicide. Women entered the labour force in larger numbers, not because they were motivated by feminism or equality, but because their husbands' wages were dropping relative to expenses or they had been laid off. Women were forced into working.\n\nThe war dividend was also over for the other victor of the Second World War, the Soviet Union. Its rise had also been a relative one. It could dominate a war devastated Europe. It was harder to dominate a resurgent Europe.\n\nUnlike with the transfer of power from Spain to Britain to America there is no new member of Team West waiting to pick up the baton and to keep the West ahead of the Rest.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nSpain, Britain and America dominated the West and the rest of the world for 500 years.\n\nBut what about the traditional reasons for the rise of the West? What about the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, Parliamentary Democracy and the rule of law? What about better European technology and a better military? All were extremely important. All were major enablers. You can't just rely on luck. You need to do something with it.\n\nWhat this article argues is that Spain and Britain's dominance would not have happened without their discovery and domination of North and South America. America's transition to global dominance would not have happened without Europe's vicious internecine warfare in the twentieth century. They were lucky.\n\nWhich raises an interesting question about the future. Has the Age of Luck run its course?\n\nThe answer is \"yes\". For now.\n\nThe world is completely mapped. There are no huge hidden continents that can be discovered, exploited and monopolised by two or three powers.\n\nA devastating war or disease outbreak has the potential to alter the balance of power. But as we have seen, it only took Japan and Germany thirty years to catch up with the US, even after being completely destroyed during the Second World War.\n\nAs a result, the future is unlikely to see any one country dominate the world so comprehensively, like Spain, Britain and America once did.\n\nCrisis: Or An Explanation On The Origins Of The Decline Of The West",

It declares that outer space \"is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\" No nation can own the Moon, Mars, or any celestial body. Space is the \"province of all mankind.\"\n\nThis treaty was written when exactly two nations could reach space, and neither could do much when it got there. It reflected the geopolitical reality of 1967: a bipolar superpower duopoly in which the United States and the Soviet Union had every incentive to prevent a destabilising space arms race. The treaty was not idealism. It was mutual deterrence dressed in idealistic language.\n\nThat world no longer exists. In 2026, SpaceX is building Starship production infrastructure at industrial scale -- Giga Bays at Starbase capable of housing over 24 workstations for simultaneous vehicle assembly. China plans a permanent crewed lunar base by 2030. NASA's Artemis programme, supported by a $4 billion SpaceX lunar lander contract, aims to return Americans to the Moon. India's Chandrayaan programme has successfully landed on the lunar south pole. Japan, the UAE, South Korea, and several private companies have active lunar or Martian programmes.\n\nThe question is not whether humans will establish a permanent presence beyond Earth. The question is who will control it, under what rules, and what it will mean for the balance of power back on Earth. History has answered this question before -- repeatedly, consistently, and violently.\n\nPart 1: Why Nations Colonise\n\nThe romantic version of colonial history emphasises curiosity, adventure, and the human spirit of exploration. The real version is simpler: nations colonise because there are resources to extract, strategic positions to control, and rivals to pre-empt.\n\nThe Portuguese did not sail around Africa to India because they were curious about Indian cuisine. They sailed because the spice trade was the most profitable commercial activity in the fifteenth-century world, and the existing overland routes were controlled by Ottoman and Venetian middlemen who extracted enormous margins. Finding a sea route to India would allow Portugal to bypass these intermediaries and capture the profits directly. The investment in exploration -- expensive, dangerous, and with a high failure rate -- was justified by the expected return.\n\nThe Spanish did not cross the Atlantic because they wanted to meet the Aztecs. They crossed because they were looking for a western route to the same spice markets. What they found instead -- gold, silver, and vast territories -- proved even more valuable. The silver mines of Potosi alone financed the Spanish Empire for over two centuries and funded the wars that made Spain the dominant European power of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe English, French, and Dutch followed for the same reasons. Each colonial venture was backed by investors who expected a return, supported by governments that expected strategic advantage, and driven by the knowledge that if they did not claim a territory, a rival would. The scramble was competitive by nature. No nation colonised in isolation. Every colonial expansion was, at least in part, a response to the colonial expansion of rivals.\n\nThe Scramble for Africa (1881-1914) distilled this dynamic to its purest form. In the space of thirty years, European powers carved up an entire continent. The Berlin Conference of 1884-85 established the rules: any European nation that could demonstrate \"effective occupation\" of a territory could claim it. The result was a frantic race to plant flags, build forts, sign treaties with local chiefs (often under duress), and draw lines on maps. By 1914, only Ethiopia and Liberia remained independent. The rest of Africa was European property.\n\nThe motivations were mixed -- resources, strategic position, national prestige, missionary zeal, and simple fear of being left behind. But the underlying logic was consistent: unclaimed territory in a competitive international system will be claimed. The only question is by whom.\n\nPart 2: The Economics of Space Resources\n\nThe Solar System is not empty. It is extraordinarily rich.\n\nThe Moon contains significant deposits of helium-3, a potential fuel for fusion reactors, as well as water ice at the poles (critical for sustaining human presence and manufacturing rocket fuel), and rare earth elements. Lunar regolith can be processed into building materials. The Moon's low gravity makes it an ideal staging point for deeper space missions -- launching from the lunar surface requires roughly one-twentieth the energy of launching from Earth.\n\nThe asteroid belt contains mineral wealth that dwarfs anything on Earth. A single metallic asteroid -- 16 Psyche, which NASA is currently studying -- is estimated to contain iron, nickel, and gold worth approximately $10,000 quadrillion at current market prices. Even a small metallic asteroid could contain more platinum-group metals than have ever been mined in human history. These are not theoretical resources. They are physical objects with known compositions, orbiting in predictable paths.\n\nMars offers something different: land. Mars has almost exactly the same surface area as Earth's landmasses (Earth is larger but mostly covered by oceans). It has water ice, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and the basic chemical building blocks needed to sustain life with the right technology. It is, in principle, terraformable -- not in years or decades, but potentially in centuries.\n\nThe economic parallel with the Age of Exploration is striking. In the fifteenth century, the spice trade was worth fortunes, but the cost of reaching the source was enormous. Ships were expensive, crews died in large numbers, and most voyages lost money. But the ones that succeeded generated returns that justified the entire programme. The same logic applies to space resources. The cost of reaching an asteroid is enormous today. But the potential return -- in rare minerals, in fuel, in strategic position -- is so large that the investment will eventually be made. The only question is when the cost curve crosses the value curve.\n\nThat crossing point is approaching faster than most people realise. SpaceX has reduced the cost of launching a kilogram to low Earth orbit from approximately $54,000 (Space Shuttle era) to under $2,000 (Falcon 9) and is targeting under $200 with Starship. At $200 per kilogram, the economics of space resource extraction begin to close. At $50 per kilogram -- which Musk has suggested is achievable with full Starship reusability -- they become compelling.\n\nPart 3: The Chartered Company Model Returns\n\nOne of the most striking features of the current space race is the role of private companies. SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, and dozens of smaller firms are not government contractors in the traditional sense. They are entrepreneurial ventures that design, build, and operate their own spacecraft, often with their own capital and their own strategic objectives.\n\nThis is not new. It is a return to the model that drove the first age of colonisation.\n\nThe English East India Company, chartered in 1600, was a private corporation with shareholders, a board of directors, and a profit motive. It also had its own army, its own navy, its own diplomatic service, and the authority to wage war, sign treaties, and govern territories. At its peak, it controlled the Indian subcontinent -- a territory with a population larger than all of Europe -- with a private military force of over 250,000 men.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company (VOC), chartered in 1602, was even more powerful. It was the first company to issue stock, the first to establish a permanent dividend, and at its height was worth more (in inflation-adjusted terms) than Apple, Google, and Amazon combined. It governed territories across Southeast Asia, maintained a fleet of over 150 merchant ships, and employed tens of thousands of soldiers and sailors.\n\nThese companies privatised the costs and risks of colonisation while capturing the profits. Governments granted them monopoly charters because the state could not afford to fund exploration and colonisation directly. The companies took the risk, and in return received exclusive rights to trade in and govern specific territories.\n\nSpaceX is the East India Company of the twenty-first century. It is a private company, funded primarily by private capital, that has developed capabilities exceeding those of most national space agencies. It launches more payload to orbit than all other providers combined. It is building the vehicle -- Starship -- that will make lunar and Martian colonisation physically possible. And its founder has stated, repeatedly and publicly, that his ultimate objective is to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars.\n\nThe parallel is not exact. SpaceX does not have a private army (yet). It operates under US government regulation and depends on government contracts for a significant portion of its revenue. But the structural similarity is unmistakable: a private entity, driven by a combination of profit motive and visionary ambition, is developing the capability to access and exploit territories that no government can currently reach on its own.\n\nPart 4: The Legal Vacuum\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty prohibits national appropriation of celestial bodies. But it says nothing about private appropriation. It says nothing about resource extraction. And it provides no enforcement mechanism.\n\nThe United States has already begun to fill this vacuum unilaterally. The Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 explicitly grants US citizens the right to own and sell resources extracted from asteroids and other celestial bodies. The Artemis Accords, signed by over 30 nations, establish a framework for \"safety zones\" around lunar operations -- areas where other nations are expected not to interfere. These are not sovereignty claims in name. But they function as sovereignty claims in practice.\n\nChina has not signed the Artemis Accords. It is pursuing its own lunar programme with its own rules. Russia, India, and others are doing the same. The result is a fragmented legal landscape in which different nations and blocs operate under different rules -- or no rules at all.\n\nThis is exactly what happened after the Treaty of Tordesillas. Spain and Portugal had their agreement. Everyone else had their ships. The nations that arrived first and established \"effective occupation\" -- the same standard used in the Scramble for Africa -- ended up owning the territory, regardless of what any treaty said.\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty will not be formally abrogated. It will simply become irrelevant, overtaken by facts on the ground -- or rather, facts on the Moon. When a nation or a company has invested billions in a lunar mining operation, has personnel on site, and has built the infrastructure to extract and transport resources, no piece of paper signed in 1967 will persuade them to leave because another nation objects. Possession, as it has been throughout human history, will be nine-tenths of the law.\n\nPart 5: Robots First, Humans Maybe\n\nThere is one critical difference between the colonial scrambles of the past and the scramble for the Solar System: robots.\n\nIn every previous colonial expansion, human beings had to go first. They had to sail the ships, build the forts, work the mines, and fight the battles. This was expensive, dangerous, and logistically complex. It required food, water, shelter, medicine, and all the other necessities of human life, transported across vast distances at enormous cost. The high mortality rates of early colonial ventures -- often 50% or more in the first year -- were a significant constraint on expansion.\n\nSpace colonisation will be fundamentally different. Robots will go first. They will survey the terrain, mine the resources, build the habitats, manufacture the fuel, and establish the infrastructure that humans will eventually use. AI systems will manage the operations, make decisions in real time, and adapt to conditions that cannot be predicted from Earth. By the time humans arrive -- if they arrive -- the hard work will already be done.\n\nThis changes the economics and the politics of colonisation dramatically. A robotic mining operation on the Moon requires no life support, no food, no medical care, no recreation, and no return ticket. It can operate continuously, in conditions that would kill a human in minutes. It can be controlled from Earth with a communication delay of only 1.3 seconds. It is, in every practical sense, a better colonist than a human being.\n\nThe nations that dominate space will therefore be the nations with the most advanced robotics and AI -- not necessarily the nations with the largest populations or the bravest astronauts. This reinforces the argument for domestic manufacturing and technological sovereignty: a nation that cannot build its own robots and AI systems will be dependent on those that can, not just on Earth but in space.\n\nPart 6: What Comes Next\n\nThe 2030s will see the establishment of permanent infrastructure on the Moon -- initially robotic, eventually crewed. Multiple nations and private companies will operate lunar bases, mining operations, and research stations. The legal framework governing these activities will be ad hoc, contested, and ultimately determined by capability rather than treaty.\n\nThe 2040s and 2050s will see the extension of this pattern to Mars and the asteroid belt. The economic returns from space resource extraction will begin to flow back to Earth, creating new industries and new forms of wealth. The nations and companies that control access to these resources will wield enormous economic and strategic power.\n\nSpace will become the ultimate expression of national capability and identity -- much as colonial empires were in the nineteenth century. The nations that reach space, build there, and extract resources will be the great powers of the twenty-first and twenty-second centuries. Those that do not will be the equivalent of the African and Asian nations that were colonised rather than colonising: dependent, subordinate, and subject to the decisions of others.\n\nThe Scramble for Africa lasted thirty years and reshaped the world for a century. The Scramble for the Solar System will last longer and reshape it permanently. The difference is that this time, the territory is effectively infinite, the resources are beyond imagination, and the colonists -- at least at first -- will not be human.\n\nThe race has already begun. The question, as always, is who will get there first.\n\nEmigration: Colonies Of The Mind And Space",

History Future Now looks ant past conflicts to shed light on these critical questions.\n\nHistory is filled with examples of wars that began with limited objectives but quickly spiralled out of control, drawing in other nations and leading to widespread destruction and loss of life. From the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century to the global conflagrations of the 20th century, seemingly minor conflicts have often escalated into full-scale wars with devastating consequences.\n\nAt the same time, nations have often gone to war with misplaced confidence, believing that they would emerge victorious and achieve their objectives quickly and decisively. But as we shall see, from ancient Athens to modern-day America, countries have found themselves mired in costly and ultimately disastrous conflicts, with victory proving elusive or coming at a tremendous cost.\n\nAs the world watches the events in Ukraine, it is essential that we learn from the lessons of history and work to prevent the conflict from escalating further. The risks of direct confrontation between Russia and NATO, or even the use of nuclear weapons, are too great to ignore.\n\nIn this article, History Future Now examines the historical precedents for the war in Ukraine, exploring how minor conflicts can escalate into major conflagrations, how nations can miscalculate the costs and consequences of war, and how the international community can work to de-escalate tensions and find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. By understanding the lessons of the past, we can hope to navigate the dangerous waters of the present and chart a course towards a more peaceful and stable future.\n\nPart 1: From Minor Skirmishes to Major Conflagrations\n\nHere are four conflicts that started off with localised problems and ended up incorporating huge swathes of the world and resulted in massive loss of life.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War began as a localized conflict in 1618. The Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, attempted to impose religious uniformity on his domains by forcing Roman Catholicism on the largely Protestant Bohemia. The Bohemian Revolt, a reaction to Ferdinand's actions, was initially seen as a minor uprising, one that could be quickly suppressed by the powerful Habsburg monarchy. Ferdinand's confidence was misplaced.\n\nAs the war progressed, it quickly escalated beyond its initial scope. Protestant states within the Holy Roman Empire, such as Saxony and Brandenburg, joined forces with Bohemia. They aimed to resist imperial authority and defend their religious freedom. The conflict also attracted the attention of other European powers, including Denmark, Sweden, and France. They saw an opportunity to expand their own influence and territories at the expense of the Habsburgs. The entry of these foreign powers transformed the conflict. What began as a localized religious dispute became a complex web of political and military struggles. The consequences for the balance of power in Europe were far-reaching.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War ultimately became one of the deadliest conflicts in European history. An estimated 8 million people died out of a total population of around 18 million in the Holy Roman Empire. The war led to widespread devastation, famine, and disease. The conflict finally ended with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. It recognized the sovereignty of the German states and established a new balance of power in Europe. However, the physical damage left by the war, to villages, towns and cities, would take generations to heal and the population of Germany did not recover for 150 years.\n\nThe Seven Years' War began as a regional dispute. Prussia and Austria over the territory of Silesia, seized by Prussia in an earlier conflict. The Prussian king, Frederick the Great, was confident in his military prowess. He was determined to solidify his gains. In 1756, he launched a preemptive attack against Austria and its allies. At the time, the conflict was seen as a continuation of the long-standing rivalry between the two German powers. Few could have predicted the far-reaching consequences that would follow.\n\nAs the war progressed, it quickly escalated beyond its initial scope. Other European powers, such as France, Russia, and Sweden, joined the conflict in support of Austria. The entry of these nations into the war transformed what had begun as a localized dispute into a global conflict. Battles were fought not only in Europe but also in the colonies of the involved powers, in North America, the Caribbean, and India. The complex web of alliances and the competing interests of the various nations led to a series of shifting alliances and military campaigns.\n\nThe Seven Years' War, described as the first true world war, resulted in an estimated 1.3 million military deaths and countless civilian casualties. The toll on the populations and resources of the involved nations was immense. Prussia alone lost approximately 180,000 soldiers, about 9% of its total population. The war finally ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. It brought about significant territorial changes and marked the emergence of Prussia as a major European power. However, the immense cost of the conflict left many of the participants financially and militarily weakened. This then set the stage for future rivalries and conflicts that would continue to shape the course of history.\n\nThe spark that ignited World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, demanding a full investigation and the suppression of anti-Austrian propaganda. Serbia, backed by its ally Russia, refused to fully comply. On July 28, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. At the time, the conflict was seen as a localized dispute in the Balkans. Few European leaders believed it would escalate into a major war.\n\nHowever, the complex system of alliances that had developed in Europe quickly drew other nations into the conflict. Germany, allied with Austria-Hungary, declared war on Russia and France. Britain entered the war in response to Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium. Within weeks, what had begun as a regional dispute in the Balkans had escalated into a full-scale European war. Millions of soldiers were mobilized and sent to the front lines. As the fighting intensified and spread to other continents, it became clear that the war would not be short or decisive. Not the conflict that many had initially anticipated.\n\nWorld War I ultimately became one of the deadliest and most destructive conflicts in human history with an estimated 9 million military deaths and 10 million civilian deaths. Trench warfare, machine guns, and chemical weapons led to unprecedented levels of carnage and suffering. The impact of the war extended far beyond the battlefields. Entire societies were mobilized for the war effort. The conflict had far-reaching social, economic, and political consequences. The end of the war in 1918 saw the collapse of four empires. National boundaries were redrawn, and new nation-states emerged. The stage was set for future conflicts and the reshaping of the global order in the 20th century.\n\nGermany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, was the immediate trigger for World War II in Europe. Adolf Hitler's long-standing ambition was to expand German territory and to establish a \"Greater Germania\". A key factor in Hitler's decision to invade Poland was the dispute over the Danzig Corridor. This strip of land separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. Hitler believed that by annexing the Danzig Corridor and the rest of Poland, he could further his expansionist goals and do so without provoking a major war with the Western powers, particularly Britain and France. He did not think that the British would go to war over the issue as they had pursued a policy of appeasement towards Germany in the years leading up to the invasion.\n\nHowever, Hitler's assumptions proved to be mistaken. Britain and France, having issued ultimatums to Germany to withdraw from Poland, declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. The entry of these nations into the conflict marked a significant escalation of the war. It transformed what had begun as a localized invasion into a wider European conflict. As the war progressed, it quickly spread to other continents. Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 drew the United States into the conflict. It transformed it into a truly global war.\n\nWorld War II ultimately became the deadliest and most destructive conflict in human history with an estimated 70-85 million deaths, including both military and civilian casualties. The war was characterised by unprecedented levels of violence, destruction, and atrocities. The impact of the war extended far beyond the battlefields. Entire societies were mobilized for the war effort. The end of the war in 1945 saw the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as global superpowers and set the stage for the Cold War.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how seemingly minor conflicts can escalate into full-scale wars with devastating consequences. The complex web of alliances, rivalries, and miscalculations that characterize international relations can turn localized disputes into global conflagrations, leaving a trail of destruction and suffering in their wake. As History Future Now has shown, the lessons of the past are clear: we must be vigilant in our efforts to prevent the escalation of conflicts in the present day.\n\nPart 2: The Illusion of Victory\n\nThroughout history, nations have often gone to war with the belief that they would emerge victorious, only to find themselves mired in costly and ultimately disastrous conflicts. The examples below demonstrate the dangers of overconfidence and the unpredictable nature of warfare.\n\nAlcibiades, a charismatic Athenian leader, convinced the Assembly to launch an ambitious expedition against Syracuse. The plan? Conquer the city, weaken Sparta's allies, and gain a strategic base in the western Mediterranean. But Alcibiades' grand vision was shattered when political rivals accused him of sacrilege, forcing him to flee to Sparta.\n\nThe Sicilian Expedition, now under the command of Nicias and Lamachus, initially made progress but soon faltered. The Syracusans, aided by Sparta and other Greek cities, outmaneuvered and decisively defeated the Athenian forces. This devastating loss weakened Athens' military and financial power, leaving it vulnerable to further attacks. Alcibiades' dream of glory and power for Athens had turned into a nightmare.\n\nIn 9 CE, Roman general Varus marched three legions into Germania. His mission? Subdue the tribes and expand the empire. He underestimated his adversary, Arminius, a Germanic leader who had once served in the Roman military. Arminius used his knowledge of Roman tactics to lure Varus into a deadly trap in the Teutoburg Forest.\n\nThe Battle of Teutoburg Forest was a catastrophic defeat for the Romans. Three legions were annihilated. Varus took his own life. The loss shattered the myth of Roman invincibility and halted further expansion into Germania. It exposed the limits of Roman power and the dangers of underestimating \"barbarian\" tribes. The ghosts of Teutoburg Forest haunted the Roman psyche for generations, a stark reminder of the perils of hubris and the importance of respecting one's enemies.\n\nIn 1588, King Philip II of Spain launched the Spanish Armada to invade England and overthrow Queen Elizabeth I. Confident in his \"invincible\" fleet, Philip believed he would crush the English navy. He thought wrong. He severely underestimated his opponents' skill and determination. The English, under the command of Sir Francis Drake, outmaneuvered and harassed the Spanish fleet with superior tactics.\n\nStorms, disease and English attacks took a heavy toll on the Armada. By the time it limped back to Spain, half its ships and thousands of men had been lost. The defeat humiliated Spain and showcased England's growing naval power. The Armada's failure marked a turning point in the balance of power in Europe and signaled the beginning of the end for Spain's dreams of domination.\n\nGermany entered World War I confident that its meticulously planned offensive would swiftly defeat France. Then they would focus on Russia in the east. They severely underestimated the effectiveness of the French and British forces, who halted the German advance at the First Battle of the Marne. The war devolved into a brutal stalemate, with both sides entrenched and unable to make significant gains despite horrific casualties.\n\nAs the war progressed, Germany faced increasing isolation and challenges on all fronts. The British naval blockade choked off vital supplies. The entry of the United States in 1917 tipped the balance in favor of the Allies. By the time Germany surrendered in November 1918, millions of men had been lost, leaving the country with a shattered economy and a deeply divided society. The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles sowed the seeds of resentment and instability that would lead to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the outbreak of World War II.\n\nRussia entered World War I in 1914 with confidence. They believed their vast size and resources would ensure a quick victory over the Central Powers. They were wrong. The Russian military was woefully unprepared for modern warfare, plagued by outdated tactics, inadequate supplies, and poor leadership. The early months of the war brought a string of disastrous defeats, with hundreds of thousands of men killed, wounded, or captured.\n\nAs the war dragged on, Russian society strained under the mounting pressure. Food shortages, inflation, and political unrest fueled discontent with the government and the monarchy. Tsar Nicholas II's decision to take personal command of the army in 1915 proved fatal. All subsequent military failures were blamed on him and his unpopular German wife and her advisors. By early 1917, strikes and protests led to the collapse of the monarchy and the establishment of a provisional government. The new government's decision to continue the war ultimately led to its downfall, paving the way for the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917 and Russia's withdrawal from the war.\n\nAustria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in 1914. They were confident that a swift victory would cement their status as a great power and solidify control over the Balkans, which had been weakening for years. However, the Austro-Hungarian military was ill-equipped and poorly led. Their initial offensives against Serbia ended in humiliating defeat. As the war expanded to include fronts against Russia and Italy, Austria-Hungary became increasingly dependent on its German ally for support.\n\nThe war took a heavy toll on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, exacerbating long-standing ethnic and political tensions. Food shortages, inflation, and the loss of millions of men led to growing unrest and calls for autonomy or independence among the empire's minority groups. By 1918, with the military situation becoming increasingly hopeless, the empire began to unravel. The death of Emperor Franz Joseph in 1916 and the inability of his successor to stem the tide of collapse sealed the fate of the Habsburg monarchy. The end of the war saw the empire dissolve into a series of independent nation-states. Centuries of Habsburg rule had come to an end.\n\nJapan launched its attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. They hoped that this would reduce the Americans' influence in the western Pacific and allow Japan to continue its expansion into East Asia. Most people, including the Emperor and his senior ministers thought that the chance of long term victory was slim. But they felt that no action would result in the unravelling of their conquests in East Asia and that was something they would not accept. The analogy given to the emperor was that if you were told by your doctor that you were going to die or you could have a surgical procedure that was 70% likely to kill you, you might as well go for the surgery. Unfortunately, the outcome was even worse than they had anticipated. The Japanese severely underestimated the resolve and industrial might of the United States, which quickly mobilized its resources and launched a massive counter-offensive.\n\nDespite initial successes, Japan found itself outmatched and overstretched as the war progressed. The Americans' island-hopping campaign in the Pacific, combined with a crippling naval blockade and devastating air raids on Japanese cities, slowly turned the tide against Japan. By the summer of 1945, with its cities in ruins, its navy destroyed, and its people facing starvation, Japan was forced to accept unconditional surrender. The war left Japan occupied, disarmed, and facing a long and difficult road to recovery. The United States emerged as the dominant power in the Pacific.\n\nThe United States intervened in Vietnam in the 1950s and 60s. They believed that their superior military technology and economic might would ensure a quick victory over the communist forces of North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. They were wrong. The Americans severely underestimated the determination and resilience of their enemies, who proved to be skilled and tenacious fighters, well-adapted to the difficult terrain and climate of Southeast Asia.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the United States found itself mired in a costly and unpopular conflict with no clear path to victory. Heavy-handed tactics, such as the widespread use of napalm and Agent Orange, alienated Vietnamese civilians and drew international condemnation. At home, the war sparked widespread protests and social unrest. Many Americans questioned the morality and necessity of the conflict. The United States' eventual withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973, followed by the fall of Saigon to communist forces in 1975, was a humiliating defeat.\n\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003. They were confident that their high-tech military would swiftly defeat Saddam Hussein's forces. They were right. They believed that Iraqis would welcome the Americans as liberators. They were wrong. The Bush administration severely underestimated the challenges of occupying and rebuilding a country as complex and fractious as Iraq and the determination of various Iraqi factions to resist what they saw as a foreign occupation.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the United States found itself mired in a bloody insurgency and sectarian conflict. The failure to find weapons of mass destruction, the key justification for the invasion, undermined the credibility of the American government. The war also had far-reaching consequences for the region. It destabilized Iraq and created a power vacuum that allowed for the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.\n\nThe United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to topple the Taliban and destroy al-Qaeda. They were driven by moral certainty and belief in the superiority of American military might. They were in for a rude awakening. The Americans severely underestimated the challenges of a conflict in a country as poor, rugged, and fractured as Afghanistan and the resilience and determination of the Taliban insurgency.\n\nDespite initial successes, including routing the Taliban and establishing a new Afghan government, the United States found itself mired in a long and costly war. The decision to divert resources and attention to the war in Iraq allowed the Taliban to regroup and regain strength. Corruption and ineffectiveness plagued the Afghan government and security forces. After two decades of war, the United States withdrew its forces in 2021, leaving behind a country still mired in violence and uncertainty. The lessons of Afghanistan, about the limits of military power and the challenges of nation-building, should be a cautionary tale. Unfortunately, it is likely that these lessons will be forgotten.\n\nThese examples demonstrate the dangers of overconfidence and the unpredictable nature of warfare. Despite their military and economic advantages, nations have often found themselves mired in costly and ultimately disastrous conflicts, with victory proving elusive or coming at a tremendous cost. As History Future Now has illustrated, the belief that military force alone can achieve political objectives is often a dangerous illusion.\n\nPart 3: The Risks of Escalation in Ukraine\n\nThe lessons of history, as explored by History Future Now, have a direct bearing on the ongoing war in Ukraine. The conflict, which began with Russia's invasion in February 2022, carries with it the risk of escalation into a wider regional or even global confrontation. The following scenarios demonstrate the potential for the war to spiral out of control, with devastating consequences for Ukraine, Russia, and the wider world.\n\nIn this scenario, Russia continues its offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine, seeking to consolidate its gains and establish a land bridge to Crimea. Ukraine, bolstered by Western military aid, launches counteroffensives to reclaim lost territory. The fighting intensifies. Both sides suffer heavy casualties. Civilian areas come under increasing attack. The conflict settles into a prolonged stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive victory, similar to the situation faced by the United States in the Vietnam War.\n\nAs the fighting in Ukraine continues, Russia launches attacks on supply lines and infrastructure in NATO countries such as Poland and Romania, which are providing military aid to Ukraine. NATO responds by invoking Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. An attack on one member is an attack on all. NATO forces are deployed to Ukraine to defend against further Russian aggression. This leads to direct confrontation between Russian and NATO troops, echoing the escalation of conflicts such as World War I and World War II.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine escalates, NATO countries begin to run low on military personnel and equipment. To sustain the fight against Russia, NATO leaders decide to implement conscription, drafting young men and women into military service. The decision leads to widespread protests and social unrest in NATO countries. Populations become increasingly war-weary. They oppose the conflict, mirroring the domestic upheaval experienced by the United States during the Vietnam War and Russia during World War I. There is a real possibility that millions of young men and women will refuse to join the ranks- especially with so many dual citizens who will argue that this is not their war. Forcing them to fight could trigger significant internal conflict and non dual citizens could then refuse to fight as they feel it is unfair. Conscription could end in the collapse of several governments, strengthening Russia's hand.\n\nAs the war drags on and the Ukrainian population grows increasingly weary of the conflict, a pro-Russian faction within the Ukrainian military stages a coup. They overthrow the current government and install a new regime more sympathetic to Russian interests. The new government moves quickly to end the war. They agree to Russian demands, including recognizing the annexation of Crimea and granting autonomy to the separatist regions in the east. The West is forced to accept the new reality. Ukraine becomes a Russian satellite state. The balance of power in the region shifts dramatically in favor of Moscow. This outcome is similar to how Russia was defeated at the end of World War 1.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine continues with no end in sight, the costs for both sides mount. Russia, despite its initial advantages, finds itself bogged down in a prolonged conflict. Its economy strains under the weight of sanctions and military expenditures. Ukraine, though bolstered by Western support, suffers devastating losses and widespread destruction. As the conflict drags on, Western nations grow increasingly weary of the war. Domestic political pressures and economic challenges lead to a gradual reduction in military aid and diplomatic support for Ukraine. Without sustained Western backing, Ukraine's position weakens. Russia, sensing an opportunity, intensifies its efforts. Eventually, Ukraine is forced to accept a peace settlement on Russian terms. The conflict ends, but at a tremendous cost. This outcome is similar to America's eventual withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine continues to escalate, with NATO forces directly engaged in fighting against Russian troops, the risk of nuclear war increases. Russia, facing the prospect of defeat and the loss of its strategic interests in Ukraine, decides to use tactical nuclear weapons to turn the tide of the war. NATO responds with its own nuclear strikes, leading to a full-scale nuclear exchange between Russia and the West. The consequences are catastrophic. Millions of people killed and much of Europe and Russia is left in ruins.\n\nThese scenarios demonstrate the potential for the war in Ukraine to escalate into a wider and more devastating conflict, with the risk of direct confrontation between Russia and NATO and even the use of nuclear weapons. As the fighting continues, it is essential that all parties involved work to de-escalate the conflict and find a diplomatic solution that prevents further bloodshed and destruction, drawing on the lessons of past conflicts and the dire consequences of escalation.\n\nPart 4: The Path to Peace in Ukraine\n\nWhile the scenarios outlined earlier paint a grim picture of potential escalation, History Future Now believes there are still viable paths to a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine. However, achieving peace will require pragmatism, compromise and difficult concessions from all parties involved.\n\nUkraine agrees to enshrine permanent neutrality in its constitution, pledging not to join NATO or any other military alliance. In exchange, Russia withdraws all troops from Ukrainian territory beyond Crimea and the separatist regions. A UN-mandated multinational peacekeeping force is deployed to monitor the ceasefire and territorial divisions. Ukraine, Russia, EU and U.S. sign a regional security pact guaranteeing Ukraine's borders and non-aligned status. This is similar to the neutrality status granted to Austria after WWII in the Austrian State Treaty of 1955 following its occupation by Allied forces.\n\nUkraine undertakes constitutional reforms to transform into a federalized state with expansive autonomy granted to Russian-majority regions like Donetsk and Luhansk over local laws, language, trade and cultural affairs. However, Kyiv retains control over national defense, foreign policy and macroeconomic matters. Russia accepts this internal Ukrainian solution in exchange for security guarantees for Russian populations and interests. This is akin to the federalisation process in Bosnia and Herzegovina agreed at Dayton in 1995 to end the Yugoslav wars, which Russia participated in enforcing.\n\nRussia's annexation of Crimea is formalized after a UN-monitored referendum confirming the peninsula's desire to join Russia. However, the Donbas regions remain under Ukrainian sovereignty with wide-ranging autonomy and guaranteed rights for Russian speakers. A demilitarized buffer zone is established, monitored by OSCE observers. While not a complete resolution, this \"frozen conflict\" model prevents further fighting while deferring a final settlement. This is similar to the status quo that emerged in Georgia's Russian-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.\n\nAs a last resort, Ukraine and Russia agree to a peaceful partition along ethnic/linguistic lines to end the conflict decisively. The Donbas oblasts and Crimea are ceded to Russia, while Russian populations in other Ukrainian areas are given a chance to relocate over a multi-year transition period. While extremely difficult, such population transfers have been used to resolve other protracted conflicts like India-Pakistan or Greece-Turkey. This is reminiscent of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence through secret protocols.\n\nNone of these scenarios represents an ideal or complete victory for any side. They all involve painful compromises on territorial integrity, security guarantees and constitutional overhauls. However, they provide potential off-ramps to prevent the alternatives of escalating destruction or a bloody, endless stalemate that serves nobody's interests.\n\nUltimately, achieving a negotiated peace will require bold leadership, pragmatic diplomacy and a willingness to put national and regional stability ahead of maximal objectives. The roads to sustainable peace are rarely straight or smooth, as History Future Now's examples have illustrated time and again. But the human costs of continued war make exploring every avenue to a peaceful settlement an imperative that cannot be ignored.\n\nTime for a Recap\n\nThroughout this article, History Future Now has explored the complex nature of warfare and the often unpredictable consequences of military conflict.\n\nOne of the key lessons that emerges from these examples is that wars often begin with limited objectives but can quickly spiral out of control.\n\nAnother crucial lesson is that leaders often go to war with misplaced confidence, believing that they can achieve a swift and decisive victory.\n\nThese lessons are particularly relevant to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which carries with it the risk of escalation into a wider regional or even global confrontation. The scenarios explored in this article, from moderate escalation to full-scale nuclear war, underscore the potential for the war to spiral out of control, with devastating consequences for Ukraine, Russia, and the wider world.\n\nUltimately, the lessons of history underscore the urgent need for diplomacy, dialogue, and restraint in the face of conflict. While the path to peace in Ukraine will not be easy, it is essential that all parties involved work to de-escalate tensions and find a diplomatic solution that prevents further bloodshed and destruction.\n\nThe alternative, as the historical examples in this article make all too clear, is a path that leads only to suffering, destruction, and the unraveling of the fragile fabric of peace that holds our world together.\n\nForging Peace: From Centuries of War to Ukraine's Future",

What is interesting is that free trade may have been an illusion all along. Read on to find out why.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the Western system of trading has changed over time. For most of the period from the 1400s the West employed a statist mercantilist system. It only become a champion of free trade in the late 1800s.In the 1400s merchants banded together to create joint stock companies that were frequently given special exclusive rights - monopolies- over certain markets or regions by their governments, in return for a share of the profits being given to the state. This enhanced the wealth and power of monarchs and made private individuals, generally merchants, wealthy. Early examples include the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers, who paid for John Cabot (an Italian) to sail to Newfoundland in 1497, the Virginia Company (memorialised by the Disney cartoon Pocohantas) who had exclusive rights to large chunks of the eastern seaboard of North America, and the English East India Company, established in 1600, which had rights to trade in the Far East. This latter company would eventually come to dominate India in the 1700s and precipitated the Opium Wars with China from 1839. The French, Germans, Portuguese, Dutch, Russians, Spanish and Scandinavians all had similar companies.\n\nWhat they all had in common was that they were anti-competitive and were violently opposed to any kind of free trade. Going abroad was risky and expensive. Once they got there and had established trading relations the last thing that they wanted to do was see new competitors come in and take market share. These trading companies became increasingly militarised and had their own armed merchantmen to transport goods and private armies to protect their far-flung trading posts, called \"factories\". The state was fully behind this protectionist sentiment, which was not just confined to trading companies. Europeans treated their colonies as sources of raw materials and, eventually, captive markets for their manufactured goods. In the American colonies, for example, the Americans would ship raw materials to Britain and would receive value added manufactured goods in return. Since the manufactured goods were more valuable than the raw materials sold the colonists supplemented their payments with gold and silver, which was then used by the British to buy other products from other countries or to increase their manufacturing capacity at home. One of the key reasons for the American War of Independence was the fact all shipping to the North American colonies had to be transported by British ships (which included American ships as they were deemed British) and that the manufacture of many goods was banned in the colonies. There are multiple letters between George Washington and his friends complaining about the high cost and low quality of goods delivered late and damaged from England.",

Early examples include the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers, who paid for John Cabot (an Italian) to sail to Newfoundland in 1497, the Virginia Company (memorialised by the Disney cartoon Pocohantas) who had exclusive rights to large chunks of the eastern seaboard of North America, and the English East India Company, established in 1600, which had rights to trade in the Far East. This latter company would eventually come to dominate India in the 1700s and precipitated the Opium Wars with China from 1839. The French, Germans, Portuguese, Dutch, Russians, Spanish and Scandinavians all had similar companies.\n\nWhat they all had in common was that they were anti-competitive and were violently opposed to any kind of free trade. Going abroad was risky and expensive. Once they got there and had established trading relations the last thing that they wanted to do was see new competitors come in and take market share. These trading companies became increasingly militarised and had their own armed merchantmen to transport goods and private armies to protect their far-flung trading posts, called \"factories\". The state was fully behind this protectionist sentiment, which was not just confined to trading companies. Europeans treated their colonies as sources of raw materials and, eventually, captive markets for their manufactured goods. In the American colonies, for example, the Americans would ship raw materials to Britain and would receive value added manufactured goods in return. Since the manufactured goods were more valuable than the raw materials sold the colonists supplemented their payments with gold and silver, which was then used by the British to buy other products from other countries or to increase their manufacturing capacity at home. One of the key reasons for the American War of Independence was the fact all shipping to the North American colonies had to be transported by British ships (which included American ships as they were deemed British) and that the manufacture of many goods was banned in the colonies. There are multiple letters between George Washington and his friends complaining about the high cost and low quality of goods delivered late and damaged from England.\n\nThe British only started advocating free trade after the American colonists successfully became independent from Britain in 1783, after the Treaty of Paris. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations was published in the 1776 (the same year as the Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire) and David Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy and Taxation was published in 1817. These books created the intellectual framework for free trade. Smith and Ricardo argued that the mercantilist system of monopolistic trading companies and exclusive colonies was bad. Society would be much better off if all companies could compete anywhere they wanted. Ricardo even promoted the idea that certain countries would be better off sticking to producing low cost goods and buying high cost goods rather than trying to do everything themselves - this is the theory of comparative advantage.\n\nAnd now things start to get really interesting. If the West believed - and had empirical proof- that monopolistic trading companies and captive colonial markets was the best way to become rich and powerful, what persuaded them to think that the exact opposite, free competition and open markets, was better? Surely it could not have been just because a Scottish intellectual, Adam Smith, and the son of a Portuguese refugee, David Ricardo, had written two books? What else was going on?\n\nThe Industrial Revolution and the shift to free trade\n\nThe answer is the Industrial Revolution. Britain's mercantilist experience had created a huge amount of surplus wealth for Britain. By the late 1700s and the early 1800s this wealth was being used to back scientists and tinkerers in the developments of new labour saving machines. Within a remarkably short period of time Britain, who led the Industrial Revolution, was able to produce goods that were cheaper, better and in far greater quantity than those produced by traditional home-based workshops. If you can produce something that is cheaper, better and in greater quantities than anyone else you essentially have no competition. And if you have no competition you are a monopoly. So if Britain could compete, and win, against everyone else the only thing that stopped Britain from selling goods all over the world the was the fact that other countries restricted the imports of British goods. That is why Britain shifted to being militantly pro free trade; free trade was nothing more than an extension of mercantilism.\n\n\"..free trade was nothing more than an extension of mercantilism.\"\n\n\"Militantly\" is not a figure of speech. Britain used force to break into closed markets. For example, China had restricted access by the British, and other European countries, to the Chinese market prior to the 1840s. China was wary of European influences and had little interest in any products that the West had to offer, other than silver. As a result, European countries ran a massive trade deficit with China. Running permanent deficits was expensive and drained Britain of foreign exchange. British searched for items that they could export to China. Eventually the British East India Company started growing poppies for opium production in India for export to China. This proved wildly successful commercially (it was also available and legal in Europe) but the Chinese government was furious about the impact the drug was having on its people. It banned the import but the British kept smuggling it into the country. In 1839 the Chinese confiscated over twenty thousand chests of opium produced by the East India Company. The British retaliated by sending in the Royal Navy which destroyed a number of Chinese ships and ports and culminated in the Treaty of Nanking, which dramatically opened up China to British and eventually other Western powers.\n\nThroughout the 1800s the British aggressively promoted free trade, confident that they were likely to win any competition. After the First World War it was the Americans who pushed for open markets and free trade as they started to dominate sector after sector thanks to their large and expanding domestic market. They actively encouraged European colonies to become independent, and open to American exports.\n\nFree trade is great when you are winning\n\nThis American enthusiasm for free markets started to wane by the 1980s as West German and Japanese products - which were cheaper and better - started to be sold in the US. Protectionist sentiments started to emerge. It was revitalised after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1989, when Western companies rushed into former soviet block markets and quickly crushed the local competition. There was another final burst of enthusiasm after 2001 when China joined the World Trade Organisation. Western and Japanese companies swarmed into China, eager to replicate their successes in eastern Europe and Russia. For a while they were successful and built factories not just for producing goods to be sold back to their home countries, making use of China's low cost labour, but also for selling to the Chinese themselves.\n\nFor a brief period of time free trade appeared to be a win-win situation for everyone. The export of manufacturing jobs to places like China was being offset by the creation of new service industries in the West. Low cost goods from China and other developing countries increased the spending power of Westerners, making them feel wealthier. And in the meantime millions of people in China were being employed making those goods for export. This brought them increased wealth and prosperity. This system of trade seemed to be text book Ricardian theory of comparative advantage - the West bought low value goods from China and sold it high value goods. Fantastic.\n\nHowever, by the early 2010s Western companies were starting to get alarmed. Chinese companies, backed by the state, were proving to be remarkably successful in competing against Western companies. China was turning out to be a gigantic trap - Western companies had arrived in China, had trained the Chinese on how to build various products and had transferred decades worth of know how. Sometimes that knowledge transfer was voluntary, but it was frequently forced as the Chinese government insisted that Western companies set up joint ventures with Chinese companies and required them to transfer critical intellectual property to the joint venture. Tempted by a huge Chinese market, Western companies agreed to these terms. Finally, the Chinese engaged in industrial espionage and stole as much western technology as they could.\n\nThis industrial espionage has a historic echo. China once had monopolies on the global manufacture of silk, porcelain and tea. These monopolies were fiercely guarded state secrets and helped China create huge amounts of wealth via exports. China lost its monopoly on silk in 552AD when silk worms, hidden in rods of bamboo, were smuggled out of the country by Christian monks. It lost its porcelain monopoly in the early 1700s when a German based at Meissen, Ehernfried Walther von Tshirnhaus, managed to reverse engineer the formula for creating a very similar product that was white, very thin, light and extremely durable. Finally, a British botanist, Robert Fortune, smuggled 20,000 tea plants and seedlings out of China between 1848 and 1851, and planted tens of thousands of hectares of tea in the Darjeeling region of India, ushering in Britain's love of the beverage.\n\nBack to the present day; one by one Chinese local players emerged that were incredibly competitive and started to beat Western companies at their own game. Western countries were not able to create new industries faster than the Chinese were able to dominate one manufacturing sector after another. The theory of comparative advantage was starting to break down. Not only was China able to produce low value goods, but it was also able to produce high value goods. The Made in China 2025 policy, which provides significant government support for key next generation industries such as artificial intelligence, robots, autonomous electric vehicles and biotechnology, will push China even further up the value chain.\n\nBy 2018 China was the world's largest manufacturer and the world's largest exporter. The Chinese economy increased from $305 billion in 1980 to $12.7 trillion in 2019; exports jumped from $21 billion in 1980 to $2.49 trillion in 2017 (well ahead of the US, in second place); and the economy has grown by an average of 10.2% between 1980 and 2016. Its products have started to dominate market after market and have driven thousands of Western companies out of business.\n\nAll of a sudden free trade was starting to look significantly less attractive to Western companies and governments. This explains why US President Trump has pushed for high tariffs on Chinese imports and Europe is starting to halt Chinese acquisitions of critical European technology companies.\n\nThe War in Ukraine: Escalation, Miscalculation, and the Path to Peace",

With this economic power you should expect political and then military dominance of the world.\n\nIt is reasonable for Westerners to expect China to dominate the world...\n\nAt least, it is reasonable for Westerners to expect this outcome. After all, that is what the West did when the intricate pathways of history, technology, luck and progress converged on Europe in the 1500s and beyond.\n\nA counter argument would say that, despite a larger population, China did not dominate the world prior to 1500. Neither did India, despite their larger populations, economic output and relative military superiority. China was relatively un-interested in the wider world. Its blue water fleet, which was capable of reaching the east coast of Africa and, theoretically, the Americas, was considerably larger and more impressive than the small Portuguese and Spanish caravels, which hugged first the shores of West Africa and then, eventually, the Caribbean. And yet the Chinese fleet was disbanded in 1433AD.\n\nEuropean dominance from the 1500s onwards was also very accidental. No serious investor believed that Columbus could reach China , or of the riches that trading directly with East Asia would bring, by heading west. The distance was simply too far (true) and no ship could carry enough provisions to get there (also true). The thought that Spain would be able to dominate China once Columbus arrived there was absurd. Later, once they had discovered the New World, the thought that a few hundred European soldiers could topple both the Aztec and Inca empires was also absurd. And yet, through the most bizarre of circumstances they did . And once they did, they had the funding and the impetus to develop technologically to such a degree that they would, eventually in the 1800s, dominate China, India and the rest of East Asia.\n\nSo what happens when China becomes the largest economy in the world? Given the fact that this is due in three years, it is likely that this scenario will happen. If the US falls deeper into a recession it might happen next year.\n\n...but what will really happen?\n\nChina is likely to follow a similar path trodden by the UK and the US. To start with, probably very little will change.\n\nThe US overtook the UK as the largest economy in the world in the 1880s. However, the UK still dominated the world politically and militarily. Had it not been for the First World War, when the Germans stupidly provoked the US into supporting the UK and France via uncontrolled submarine attacks on US shipping, and by an ill fated attempt to get Mexico to invade the US, and in the Second World War, when the Germans stupidly declared war on the US following the equally stupid Japanese attack of Pearl Harbour, the US would never have become as internationally dominant as it did. Remember that the American Century was only possible because the industrial base of all of their rivals in Europe and Japan had been wiped off the face of the planet in World War Two. All the best brains, including Nazis and Communists ones, fled to the US in the hope of better lives. This one off boost ended almost two generations ago, and is one reason why the US's dominance is fading.\n\nThe US was very resentful of the UK's continued dominance of the world from the late 1880s onwards, despite being the larger economy. It had no desire to fight on behalf of the UK in order to maintain the UK's dominance of the world - hence their reluctant support during the world wars and the overt anti European policy during the Suez Crisis of 1956. China is likely to have a similar sentiment - that of powerless resentment. It is very hard to topple a major power without some calamity affecting it.\n\nThere is also no guarantee that China's industrial dominance will last.\n\nFor the first time in history, the world faces a global constriction of natural resources relative to population growth. Food production barely keeps up with population growth . Fresh water , fisheries, fertilisers, timber, oil and gas supplies (with the exception of the short lived fracked gas boom in the US) are all declining. China is not endowed with large natural resources and a large population makes it more vulnerable to external shocks than the US, which still has abundant natural resources and a more manageable population size.\n\nLike Japan in 1941, China may conclude that it needs to go to war in order to secure more natural resources, but the reality of nuclear war is such that aggressive expansion to secure resources is fraught with serious downside risks. Despite China's desire to appear to have a monolithic and long historical continuity, the reality is that it has been smashed and split apart multiple times over the past 2,500 years. China is probably more pragmatic and is likely to continue to colonise Africa by stealth to get the resources it needs.\n\nIn addition, advanced factory robots and 3-D printing may result in more manufacturing being done closer to home, significantly undermining China's manufacturing superiority.\n\nSo, barring a major war or calamity, it is likely that China's usurpation of the Unites States as the largest economy in the world will result in almost no change at all to the world's status quo for at least a generation, if not two. We might watch more Chinese films, buy more Chinese homegrown brands, learn Mandarin at school and borrow from Chinese financial institutions.\n\nWe already love Chinese food. Nobody could ever say that about British or American food.\n\nWhy China Could Invade Taiwan - And Get Away With It",

As a result, the US is a major arms supplier to Taiwan, providing it with the means to defend itself against an attack by China.\n\nAnd yet the US is deliberately vague as to what they would do if China did attack Taiwan. If Taiwan peaceably joins China and brings its US designed and built military hardware over to Mainland China, the US will have essentially been transferring military hardware and know-how to its emerging regional rival.\n\nHistory Future Now looks at how China could invade Taiwan without firing a shot, and why it would get away with it. But first, a quick historical overview of how Taiwan became Taiwan.\n\nHow Taiwan became Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan first appears in Western maps in 1544, when Portuguese spotted the island and called it Ilha Formosa - Beautiful Island . At the time it was populated with Taiwanese aborigines who spoke an Austronesian language that is similar to what is found across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, ranging from Madagascar to the west, Hawaii and Easter Island to the east and New Zealand to the south.\n\nIn 1623 Dutch traders built a fort on the island and within ten years had fully established themselves there. Mainland Chinese forces invaded and kicked out the Dutch in 1662 and the island officially fell under Qing Dynasty rule from 1683. Under Qing rule the number of immigrants from Mainland China increased substantially and in 1885 Taiwan was made a Chinese province.\n\nJapan also had eyes on Taiwan and had attempted to take over the island from the 1590s. After the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-95, which China lost, Japan took over Taiwan. Japanese language education eventually became compulsory and over 100,000 Taiwanese served in the military of the Japanese Empire during WW2. It appears that the Japanese ran Taiwan quite well, with low levels of corruption. In 1943, at the Cairo Declaration, the Allies declared that the return of Taiwan to China was one of the war objectives and in 1952 Japan formally renounced its sovereignty over the island.\n\nAnd now things start to get more complicated.\n\nThe Allies had declared that Taiwan was to be returned to China. But who was the legitimate government of China?\n\nThroughout most of the 1930s and 1940s China had been both at war with Japan and with itself. The Chinese Kuomingtang (KMT) government, headed by Chiang Kai-Shek was on the losing side of the civil war against the Communists and fled to Taiwan in 1949, along with 2 million refugees and set up a provisional Republic of China capital in Taipei. A few months later, in October, the victorious Communists founded the People's Republic of China.\n\nUntil the early 1970s most Western countries recognized the Republic of China as the official government of all China and deemed the Communist government on the mainland as illegitimate. However, in 1971 the UN General Assembly kicked the Republic of China out of the United Nations and replaced the Republic of China with the People's Republic of China. At a stroke, the Republic of China ceased to exist diplomatically.\n\nFor much of the post war period Taiwan was in a state of marshal law with the expectation that Taiwan would mount an invasion of Mainland China to retake what was \"rightfully\" theirs. As the reality of the situation set in, the country began to open up to democracy and the country's first democratic presidential election took place in 1996.\n\nMainland China took the opportunity of the election to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate with a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait, forcing the US, under President Clinton, to send two aircraft carrier task forces to Taiwan to \"monitor the situation\". China stopped the missile tests.\n\nOver the past two decades Taiwan has gradually become more democratic, despite assassination attempts and corruption charges on its political elites. In 2004 the People's Republic of China enacted an anti-secession law that allows the use of force against Taiwan in the event that the Republic of China formally declares independence from the mainland.\n\nBecoming one China, again\n\nToday, relations between the two Chinas are better than they have been for a long time. There are direct flights between China and Taiwan and there have been high-level meetings with officials on both sides. Under the 1992 Consensus both sides recognize that there is only one China and that both Mainland China and Taiwan belong to the same China. They disagree, as is to be expected, on which party is the legitimate representative of that one China. The People's Republic of China profess that the PRC is the sole representative and the Republic of China says that the ROC is the sole representative.\n\nIn 2009 Mainland Chinese investors were allowed to invest in Taiwan's stock exchange, so long as they do not exceed a 10% stake in Taiwanese companies. Mainland Chinese are also now allowed to visit Taiwan as tourists.\n\nDespite all of this good talk, the People's Liberation Army has over 2,000 ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan according to a RAND report on possible causes of a US - Chinese military conflict.\n\nAs China's military modernization progresses, the US ability to confidently back up their rhetoric is eroding. In the near term, China is deploying capabilities that threaten US land and sea power projection platforms (air bases and aircraft carriers) as well as Taiwan's own defenses.\n\nThe People's Republic of China has been very patient with Taiwan. It knows that time is on its side. However, it could also push the issue within the next few years and force Taiwan to rejoin Mainland China under the authority of the PRC.\n\nThe PRC could show Taiwan a stick and a carrot. The stick is that Mainland China will invade to reestablish control over Taiwan. Both the Taiwanese government and the Mainland Chinese government say that they are not separate nations, but one, with different governments. The US would not enter into a \"civil war\" with the two Chinas. In addition, bearing in mind that the US has a huge trade deficit with both China and Taiwan and that the Taiwan Straits are effectively already off limits to the US Navy, it is hard to see the US defending Taiwan, even if it could afford to do so, which it cannot, or were able to do so, which it could not.\n\nAs a carrot, the Mainland Chinese market has become increasingly attractive to Taiwanese businesses. The PRC could offer increased incentives, such as low cost loans from the PRC, to Taiwanese companies, and better market access making the business classes increasingly open to reunification with Mainland China.\n\nSo here is the critical defense question for the US: if a one China is inevitable and the People's Republic of China will end up being in control of Taiwan, why is the US continuing to provide sophisticated weaponry to Taiwan? It will inevitably end up in the hands of Mainland China.\n\nIs this such a good idea?\n\nWhy Do We Need The Military? Securing Energy Supplies And Trade Routes",

Both of which are not worth fighting for. Read on to discover the astounding statistics to show why.\n\nProtecting our nation against invasion and attack\n\nHistorically the purpose of the military has been to defend our nation's borders against invasion and external attack. And yet if you look at our most recent military encounters in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya it is clear that our military was not used for this purpose. None of those countries were about to invade our nation's borders.\n\nThe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were arguably about defending our nations against external attack. The invasion of Afghanistan was based on the fact that its government had aided and abetted a terrorist group that had attacked the United States. Afghans refused to hand over members of Al Quaida and so the invasion was justified in hunting down Al Quaida extremists. In theory, once the Al Qaida members had been killed or captured, the military requirement would disappear.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was based on evidence, eventually discovered to be false, that Iraq had both the capacity and intent to strike out against the West. After refusing to hand over the weapons of mass destruction that he did not possess Saddam Hussain found himself in the crosshairs of one of the most sophisticated military operations in history. In theory, once this threat had been eliminated, the military requirement of being in Iraq would disappear.\n\nThe attacks on Libya fail both of these premises. Colonel Gaddafi posed no threat of invasion to any country and he was not threatening to attack any country either. In fact Colonel Gaddafi had recently received a visit from the then UK Prime Minster Blair in the hope of securing oil contracts for British companies.\n\nUnfortunately, the aftermath of Western attacks on Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has been chaos. None of the three countries is expected to be able to invade any country any time soon. None of those countries are expected to attack or launch attacks on our country any time soon either. Arguably, the chaos created is so great that these countries could spawn extremist groups that would launch terrorist attacks on the countries that had just invaded them. At the moment, however, they seem to be content to kill their compatriots of other ethnic and religious persuasions or the foreign military forces that remain.\n\nSo the answer to the first question appears to be more complex than merely defending our nation's borders against invasion and external attack.\n\nDo we do it for humanitarian reasons?\n\nWestern intervention in Libya has been put down to humanitarian needs. But then there are many parts of the world, in particular Africa, that are embroiled in civil wars at this moment in time. There are humanitarian needs in these places but no Western boots on the ground. Syria is going through a civil war that is almost identical to that which occurred in Libya, but the West has banned large arms sales to rebels there. We have not even bombed Syrian government forces. By a similar stage in the conflict in Libya we were attacking Gaddafi forces daily.\n\nSo humanitarian reasons are not valid uses of military power, otherwise we would be invading countries all of the time.\n\nIs it all about energy security?\n\nOne frequent accusation from people of a left leaning political persuasion is that it is all about oil. Attacking Iraq was all about securing oil supplies. Libya is also a large oil producer and so once the civil war had started the West thought that it would be best to finish on the side of the victors. Since it is very hard to prop up a failing, unpopular regime, it made more sense to blow it up and join the victory parade with the rebels. This would explain why we are not intervening in Syria and parts of Africa. They have no oil and so it is not worthwhile.\n\nWhilst this makes for a great conspiracy theory - a grab for oil - the reality is far less exciting but significantly more illogical. Have a look at the 2011 imports of oil table below in thousands of barrels of oil per day to the United States, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n\nFirstly, most oil that the US consumes comes from the United States itself. Of the imports, the bulk comes from the Western Hemisphere: Canada (26%), Mexico (7%), Venezuela (10%), Colombia (4%), US Virgin Islands (2%), Ecuador, (2%), Brazil (1%), Aruba (1%) and Trinidad and Tobago (1%). A chunk comes from sub Saharan Africa with Nigeria (9%) as the biggest player. The Middle East and North Africa do provide a good slice, but it is dominated by Saudi Arabia (13%), Iraq (5%), Algeria (4%) and Kuwait (2%). Libya clearly used to export more oil to the US, but not a huge amount - in 2007 it exported the equivalent of Trinidad and Tobago in 2011.\n\nIf the US were to suddenly stop all imports from countries that sponsor terrorism that attack the United States, such as from Saudi Arabia, who is frequently referred to as the cash machine of Wahhabi Islam, the impact on US imports would be relatively minor. Other countries could fill in the gap. And this is where things get interesting. In another Chapter (P_) History Future Now observed that:\n\nThe military cost of supporting cheap oil, however, is even more extraordinary. According to another survey, the cost of the US maintaining its fleet in the Persian Gulf (explicitly to defend oil shipping lanes) was $7,300 billion between 1976 and 2007 - or GBP 235 billion on average per year. The direct US cost of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan (excluding the First Gulf War) between 2001 and 2010 is estimated to be $2.6 trillion (or $300 billion per year) and could go as high as $4.4 trillion.\n\nSo given the fact that it costs the US between $535,000,000,000 per year to maintain its fleet and troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the US imports a total of 1,843,000 barrels per day from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq or 672,695,000 barrels per year. The cost is equivalent to a subsidy of $795 per barrel of oil. So while it may cost a little more than $2 per barrel to pump oil out of the ground in Saudi Arabia and can be sold at $92 per barrel, providing the Saudis with a profit of $90 per barrel, it costs the US taxpayer an additional $349 per barrel to maintain the US Persian fleet during a normal year and a whopping $795 per barrel when you include the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSo for the US, the marginal cost of Persian Gulf oil is between $441 and $887 per barrel. If it could find oil for less than that, it would be better off. And it can. Based on these numbers, the 24% of oil that the US imports from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and Algeria, costs 2.63 times more than ALL of the other oil it imports from the rest of the world combined.\n\nGiven the cost of the US's involvement in the Middle East, we would have to add energy security to the reasons why the US maintains a large military budget. This reason brings the total rationale for maintaining a military to three: preventing an invasion, defending against attack and maintaining energy supply security. It is worth observing that the final aim is ironic. It is the US's maintenance of security in the Middle East that makes the Muslim world perceive it as an aggressive power, which makes them more likely to want to attack the West, which makes the cost of securing supply even higher.\n\nIs it about protecting and enhancing free movement of trade?\n\nBut if you look at the US defense budget, it becomes clear that securing oil supplies is not the only reason for the deployment of military forces, as the USPACOM website helpfully elaborates:\n\nThe United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) encompasses about half the earth's surface, stretching from the waters off the west coast of the U.S. to the western border of India, and from Antarctica to the North Pole. The 36 nations that comprise the Asia-Pacific region are home to more than 50% of the world's population, three thousand different languages, several of the world's largest militaries, and five nations allied with the U.S. through mutual defense treaties. Two of the three largest economies are located in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nU.S. military and civilian personnel assigned to USPACOM number approximately 325,000, or about one-fifth of total U.S. military strength. U.S. Pacific Fleet includes six aircraft carrier strike groups, approximately 180 ships, 1,500 aircraft and 100,000 personnel. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific possesses about two-thirds of U.S. Marine Corps combat strength, includes two Marine Expeditionary Forces and about 85,000 personnel assigned. U.S. Pacific Air Forces is comprised of approximately 40,000 airmen and more than 300 aircraft, with about 100 additional aircraft deployed to Guam. U.S. Army Pacific has more than 60,000 personnel assigned, including five Stryker brigades. Of note, component command personnel numbers include more than 1,200 Special Operations personnel. Department of Defense Civilians and Contractors in the Pacific Command AOR number about 40,000. Additionally, the U.S. Coast Guard, which frequently supports U.S. military forces in the region, has approximately 27,000 personnel in its Pacific Area.\n\nCrudely put, \"one fifth\" of total US military strength is 20% of the $687,000,000,000 spent on defense in 2011, or $137 billion, which is slightly smaller than China's entire defense budget and more than double that of the UK's entire defense budget for the similar period. As you can read from the USPACOM introduction, the bulk of these forces comprise of the Navy and Marines. Their job is to protect sea-lanes.\n\nThis raises two additional questions: Who are we protecting? And what are we protecting them from? Clearly, we are not protecting US territory - with the exception of Hawaii and a few Pacific islands. There is no terrorist threat in this part of the world. We are providing protection for our allies - Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Australia. But against whom? Pirates don't really warrant $137 billion of expenditure and six carrier strike groups. The only obvious target is China, the up and coming superpower. China is also one of US' largest trading partners, with whom the US has run a trade deficit of $295,000,000,000 in 2011 and $273,000,000,000 in 2010.\n\nJust to make this clear: the US spends $137 billion per year on its military in the Pacific so that it can lose $295 billion per year to China. The US also loses $63 billion to Japan, $13 billion to Korea, $15 billion to Taiwan and $14 billion to India: a total of $400 billion per year. It actual makes money from Australia, but at $17 billion this is not enough to offset much of the loss.\n\nAs we have examined in other chapters, these trade deficits do not just represent something inconvenient, but represent the hollowing out of the economies of developed countries as jobs, skills, technology and capital are transferred on an epic scale to places like China and India.\n\nAnd yet, as with securing energy supplies in the Middle East, the US and other developed countries are paying subsidies to lose these jobs.\n\nIf we did things differently would we need to spend so much on the military?\n\nThis brings us to the conclusion and to the second question that we asked at the beginning of this article: if we did things differently would we need to spend so much on the military?\n\nThe US's Founding Fathers hated the concept of a large standing army and viewed it as a means of oppression of the people. They called for militias to be established that could come to the aid of the nation in the event of an invasion. Just under 200 years later, Republican President Eisenhower, a Second World War hero, famously said the following at his Presidential farewell address in January 1961:\n\nA vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...\n\nThis conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.\n\nWe must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.\n\nSo picking up on his call for an \"alert and knowledgeable citizenry\" History Future Now raises some challenges.\n\nThe first role of a government is to defend its borders and its people. There is no doubt that that purpose is critical and Ike would agree. The Founding Fathers called for militias, though that is probably slightly anachronistic. Whether we need to project power overseas is a different question.\n\nUsing our military to secure energy supplies is, as the statistics show, an absurd waste of money. For the cost of maintaining the US navy in the Persian Gulf on an annual basis and throwing in the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US could become completely energy independent. It could have provided free solar panels to every US household and commercial building, created wind farms, battery storage capacity, smart grids and electric cars for all. For that price it could have disengaged from the Middle East, reducing the friction with the Muslim world, reducing the likelihood of terrorist attacks and reduced the cash available for the funding of terrorist organisations by Saudi Arabia\n\nUsing our military to provide the safe transport of goods from China and India also makes no sense. The military budget plus the trade deficit adds up to over $537 billion per year to this region. Why are we paying that amount of money every year so that our economies can get hollowed out, our young people can have no jobs and our retired people lose out on their pensions? In another chapter we discussed the establishment of trading zones for similar countries. These zones would have free trade within and tariff barriers surrounding them. A foreign company wanting to sell manufactured goods and services within the trading zone would be free to do so - so long as you created the factory and jobs to do so within the trading zone: just like China does today. This would help stop countries from competing in a race to the bottom on wages and environmental and job protections.\n\nIf we did these things we would not need to spend so much on our military and we would have a healthier global economy at the same time.\n\nThis is a reason for optimism.\n\nThe West's romance with Free Trade is ending.

      "full_text": "Many years ago HFN spent a wonderful day in the company of a beautiful Russian woman. She had a warm smile and long legs that never seemed to stop. She was also very smart and had a master's degree in engineering. I had met her the previous night at an expensive Moscow restaurant.\n\nI say restaurant. But that was upstairs. Downstairs, it was a brothel.\n\nThis beautiful young engineer was a prostitute and her job was to have sex with any man willing to pay her.\n\nThe year was 1996. I was 21. Boris Yeltsin was President and would remain so for another three years. He had become President of the Russian Federation in 1991, after the Soviet Union collapsed. For five drunken years he had stuffed the country into a gigantic blender of economic reform, price liberalisation and privatisations. Out of this chaos emerged a shredded and mangled society. Corrupt, desperate and ruled by oligarchs and kleptocrats.\n\nIt was my first trip to Moscow. I was there for a finance conference along with my boss and a colleague from my office in London. My colleague had lived in Russia as a teenager and spoke the language well. After our first day he invited us out on a tour of the best places in town.\n\nI had already spent some time living in Poland and Hungary so was reasonably familiar with life in former communist countries. My father had been involved in the privatisation and the reform of their banking sectors. Eventually he would move to Armenia, where I would visit him as well.\n\nWhat struck me most of all was how topsy turvey society had become since the collapse of communism. Our driver in Poland, for example, had once been a senior electrical engineer, with a PhD, and had worked for the railways.\n\nOur Moscow destination was even more extreme. An eye opener to what can happen to a rich, well-educated, western society in under five years.\n\nWe went to a restaurant. The three of us had dinner upstairs. We sat in a pen in the middle of the room. All around the edges of the room, on elevated stools, sat beautiful women. There were mirrors on the walls so they could look at us indirectly. The food and wine was excellent.\n\nThe downstairs area had a long bar and a dance floor. It was filled with western men, mainly middle aged Americans and Europeans from the same finance conference, and beautiful young Russian women. My eyes were telling me that I was in a brothel, but my brain was telling me that this could not be the case - why would my married boss and colleague have taken me here? They couldn't seriously have taken me to a brothel? Surely not? No!\n\nWell, yes.\n\nAt the time I was unfamiliar with the social etiquette of brothels. Normally if you went to a bar as a young single person and there are other young single people there that you find attractive you would go over and start up a conversation. Perhaps tell a joke, or ask them about what they did.\n\nBut I knew what all these women did. They were prostitutes. I asked my Russian-speaking colleague for advice. \"Ask them about their families and what they studied at university,\" came the response.\n\nAnd so I did. It emerged that most of these women were not just beautiful but also very well educated. They were witty and spoke English with a delightful, soft, accent. Most appeared to have a degree of some sort.; many were engineers and scientists. Many had husbands and children.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union people would work without pay for months. That is if they had a job to go to. Factories and whole neighbourhoods had been abandoned, as if taken out by some strange non-destructive bomb. There were no science jobs. No engineering jobs.\n\nAnd yet while there was nothing that their men could do, there was one ancient profession that these women could resort to when no other option was available. These women had collectively made a difficult choice. Starve. Or lie on your back for a few hours a week. Earn enough money to pay for food, the rent and to keep your family safe. Maybe even find a nice western man who could suddenly take you away from this life that mocked everything that you had worked and hoped for.\n\nThe evening was over. We got into a taxi. My boss was in front, with the driver. I sat in the back, with my colleague. In between us was Yulia, who was beautiful. We arrived at the hotel and Yulia was ushered through the lobby. The hotel staff looked at us disapprovingly. They had seen her before. They also knew what she did.\n\nLooking around us today...\n\nIt is now November 2013. The weather is cold, like it was in Moscow, and as I reflect on events seventeen years ago I have a terrible sense of deja vu. Except I am not in Moscow, I am in London.\n\nAll around me are economic migrants. The young waiters are Spanish, Greek, Portuguese and French. They are dressed smartly and are hard working. There are few jobs for them in their own country. 61% of young people in Greece have no job. 51% of young people in Spain have no job. 40% of young people in France have no job.\n\nBut these foreign waiters and nannies do have jobs. They were smart enough to leave. The unemployment percentages would be higher if so many had not emigrated. Talk to them. You will discover that most say that they were university educated. When they were growing up they were told how exciting their futures would be. They would leave university and get a great job and become upwardly mobile young professionals.\n\nInstead they found that there were no jobs to go to. No employer wanted them. After a while they packed their bags and got a cheap flight to Gatwick and ended up living on the floor of a flat, rented by a fellow emigrant. Friends told them of job openings and they put aside their aspirations and started to serve food instead. Those with good English had more opportunities. Young women with masters degrees got jobs as nannies or au pairs. A few got jobs with professional companies, making use of their talents. None of them expect to return home. Nothing awaits them.\n\nOver twenty percent of young Britons have no job either. This is not as bad as it is in other European countries. But it means that the job market is very tight. Those that do have jobs are aware of how lucky they are. Wages are kept low and expectations of what they will be able to achieve in life are kept even lower.\n\nTwenty years ago it was still possible for young people to leave university, get a job and shortly afterwards put a down payment on a small house or flat. Thatcher had made home ownership for millions a distinct possibility. Council houses were sold off to the private sector and financial deregulation had allowed banks to flood the housing market with cheap, no questions asked, mortgages.\n\nToday that dream is dead for most young people. House prices are so far in excess of normal salaries that the only way they can get onto the housing market is for them to be given big deposits by their family. Most young people rent until their late twenties or early thirties.\n\nThis change in living standards has a knock on effect on when they get married and when they have children. In some European countries, like in the Netherlands, renting property and having children out of wedlock is not only acceptable, it is quite normal. In the UK it is not. Yet.\n\nSo young professional couples are waiting until their early thirties to get married. Do they have a big wedding, or a small civil service and use the money that was going to be spent on the wedding towards a downpayment on a house? If they wait too long it will be hard for many couples to have more than one or two children. With heavy levels of debt and no decent jobs most couples will find stressful fertility treatments too expensive, unless such treatment is funded by a national health service, one that is already strapped for cash.\n\nBut this truncated dream of owning a small house late in life and having one or two children is only going to be available to those few who can afford it. There are two other options.\n\nOne is that you skip the whole job angst, live off unemployment and social benefits, and have as many children as you want. This will work for a while. But at some point there will be such a strong public backlash that those benefits will be taken away. Hoping for charity when people don't have the money to even look after themselves is risky. Disappointment is likely.\n\nAnother option is to set your aspirations even lower. Don't expect to own a house or ever have more than one child. This is what most Russians had to do after the fall of the Soviet Union. They put off having children. For twenty years, between 1965 and 1985 Russia's fertility rate bumbled along at around replacement level, between 2.13 and 2.05 children per woman. The early Gorbachev era saw an increase in fertility as life seemed to be better and the fertility rate moved up to a high of 2.22 in 1987. Then times became uncertain. A mere 12 years later, when Yeltsin left office in 1999, the fertility rate had dropped to 1.17. It gradually recovered under Putin and as of 2011 stood at 1.54. Russia's population is still going to contract.\n\nSome people will do well in the new economy. Capital is becoming more important. Capital buys robots that can do factory work. Capital buys software and servers to siphon off many service sector jobs. If your job assists robots and makes software better you should do well financially. If your job requires you to compete with then, you will do badly.\n\nThose that do well will be able to afford more \"home help\". But it is not realistic to hope that even the very rich will have lots of servants. We will not be returning to a life of Downton Abbey. Machines and labour saving devices take care of most servants' jobs. Houses are also no longer compatible with large numbers of servants packed into attics and cellars. But rich people may need one or two people to help with managing their affairs and children. For many university-educated people this might be a good option. You might get to live with a family in a nice area. Even if they pay you a low wage, your discretionary income could be greater than if you had to commute and rent your own place with a more conventional job.\n\nLooking forward...\n\nThis Lost Generation does not just affect young people. If young people don't have jobs or only have badly paid jobs they can't afford to buy many things. This is bad news for those that sell goods and services to the youth market. Those companies will close down and lay off workers, making jobs harder to find and to keep. If younger people don't have jobs they will pay very little in taxes and are likely to take out more from the economy in terms of unemployment benefits than they put in.\n\nEverybody else will have to pick up the slack. That means higher taxes for those that have incomes and lower levels of service as less money is available for spending. If you are a pensioner who is going to pay for your pension? Don't make the mistake in thinking that your government pension is going to be paid out of money that you put into your pension pot years ago. That money was spent looking after people who were pensioners when you were young. Your pension comes directly out of taxpayers today. Populations were once described as pyramids - with a few old people at the top and lots of young people at the bottom. They could afford to pay for the few old people. Now populations in developed countries are described as kites, with lots of old people and few young people. Pyramids are stable. Kites fall over.\n\nGovernments are currently in denial that the Lost Generation is a real problem. A little bit of growth and we will get out of this slump. Everything will be fine. Don't worry. They are sleepwalking towards a cliff. In their dreams all these problems will go away, as if life were a movie and some crazy plot device will be introduced which will miraculously make everything better.\n\nSoon Governments will flounder around trying to find solutions. The problem is that any solution will take time to work its way through. Politicians will not have a lot of time. With four year electoral terms as the norm politicians should expect to lose every election as a disgruntled electorate kicks them out for failing to resolve the crisis and for failing to meet their unrealistic electoral promises. Political parties already lack credibility and legitimacy.\n\nAn added problem is that any potential solution will involve the entire country in the experiment. There will be a lot of pressure to fiddle with the solution on a continuous basis, meaning that the initial solution, which might have worked, won't be followed through, making it impossible to tell whether the solution was good or bad. Scientific experiments need a control - in democratic politics there are none.\n\nOne easy solution to this crisis is mass immigration. This will be a tempting solution for many governments. Large numbers of young immigrants will pay the taxes for the older people. The kite becomes a pyramid again. But if there are no jobs for the indigenous young people will mass immigration really fix the problem? Or make it worse? Immigrants will come in, find no jobs and will stay. It is almost impossible to discriminate against them in the European Union by not allowing them access to unemployment and social security benefits. Deporting them is also next to impossible, for legal reasons. And eventually they will get old and will want a pension too. In the meantime the country will become demographic makeup of the country will become unrecognisable.\n\nAnother tempting solution is to get rid of annoying voters. Change voting requirements to make it harder for young people to have a political voice. The US already has clever ways of stopping African Americans from voting. Many States make registration a requirement. And then make it next to impossible for African Americans to register. Others make criminals ineligible to vote. And then they lock up millions of African Americans for petty drug related crimes. It would be an easy step to make owning a property a requirement for registering to vote. If you don't own a property you can't register, and if you can't register you can't vote. At a stroke most young people will have no official political voice. Older voters are wealthier, more reliable, own property and are more populous. This will help ensure politicians protect the needs of older people over younger people.\n\nBut it won't solve the problem.\n\nConclusion: Back to 1996\n\nMy short time living and traveling in former Communist block countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union demonstrated to me personally that wealthy, well-educated, western societies can fall apart relatively quickly, even in modern times. The collapse of the Soviet Union took everybody by surprise. Russia still has not really recovered. In its aftermath political scientists could point to factors that made the whole soviet experiment unsustainable. Hindsight is perfect.\n\nThe West and the world today have so many structural problems that, unlike the Soviet Union, it requires little imagination to forecast a collapse. Crises can take a long time to resolve. The Great Depression that started in 1929 was a crisis of western capitalism that was only resolved by the Second World War.\n\nThis Lost Generation is a significant social crisis. Really bad things will happen to people that you know and love if it is not resolved.\n\nThe good news is that if you look at previous empires, ranging from the Roman Empire to the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman Empire it is amazing how long systems that are broken can survive. Sometimes not just for years, but for centuries!\n\nPostScript\n\nSo what happened with Yulia, the beautiful Russian engineer, the long legged prostitute?\n\nI woke up the next morning, alone.\n\nI knocked on the neighbouring bedroom door and my Russian-speaking colleague opened it, tightening his dressing gown. At the back of the room I got a glimpse of Yulia getting dressed. A silhouette against the window. Since I had nothing planned that day- my role at the conference was over- he suggested that Yulia take me on a tour of the city.\n\nFor the rest of the day I wandered the streets of Moscow with this beautiful, long legged, woman who was wearing high heeled black boots, a short leather dress and fishnet stockings. There was no mistaking it - she looked like a prostitute.\n\nWe were stared at by soldiers as I walked through Red Square, past the Kremlin's red walls and St Basil's Cathedral's iconic multicoloured onion domes. We were stared at by gnarled old women as we went down into Moscow's absurdly deep subway system and got off at train stations that looked like rich palaces, fitted with chandeliers. Finally, we were stared at by my Russian-speaking colleague, in horror, as Yulia took me back to the office reception at the end of the day.\n\nAs I look back at my delightful day with Yulia I think how her story could have been the story of many of my female friends. I could have gone to university with her. She could have been my sister.\n\nWhat frightens me personally about this youth unemployment crisis, this Lost Generation, is that time is running out to fix it. Soon my daughters will be Yulia's age.\n\nWhat choices will they have to make? What choices will your daughters have to make?",

Citizens are highly unlikely to be willing to pay taxes if they got nothing in return: no schools, no roads, no hospitals, no national defense, no jails and no legal system.\n\nUnfortunately, unlike other government expenditures, such as on defense, education and social security, interest payments need to be repaid. If they are not, the government will default on its debts, making it harder to borrow more money and to roll over the debt that it already has.\n\nSo in a situation where it will be both impossible to pay the interest and impossible not to pay the interest, what will happen? One answer is to artificially get rid of the debt. Historically there have been two main ways to achieve this: debt jubilees and hyperinflation.\n\nDebt Jubilee\n\nWhat is a debt jubilee? Babylonian kings occasionally issued one off decrees for the cancellation of debts and the release of slaves to their homelands.\n\nThe Book of Leviticus in the Bible describes a debt jubilee in Chapter 25:10 as follows:\n\nThis fiftieth year is sacred - it is a time of freedom and of celebration when everyone will receive back their original property, and slaves will return home to their families.\"\n\nAs this was codified, it appears to be an enhancement of the Babylonian practice, which was more subject to the whims of a particular ruler.\n\nThe Romans had debt jubilees too. For the Romans, indebtedness could result in persons selling themselves into slavery in order to pay down the debts. On a debt jubilee their debts would be forgiven and they would be released from slavery.\n\nWhat was important about debt jubilees is that they reset the clock on debts that had gone out of control. This was clearly of great benefit to those who had been indebted and potentially enslaved in order to pay for their debts\n\nHyper inflation\n\nHyper inflation is also an ancient method of wiping out accumulated debts and resetting the economic clock. The Romans started to debase their currency during the crisis of the third century AD. Gold and silver coins would be issued that had higher and higher percentages of base metals.\n\nThis practice caused huge problems to trade. After many years of failed attempts to halt the debasement of the Roman currency the Emperor Diocletian issued an Edict on Maximum Prices ( Edictum de pretiis rerum venalium ). The edict stamped down on currency debasement and imposed a maximum price ceiling for over a thousand products and wages of specific trades.\n\nThese price controls were almost impossible to enforce and also created parallel black markets to facilitate trade. By the time of his death, most of the price restrictions had been abandoned.\n\nHyper inflation became even easier with the introduction of paper currency. Shifting money off the gold standard meant that there was no direct link between paper money and gold held on deposit.\n\nOne of the most famous cases of hyperinflation during recent times was that of the German Weimar Republic after World War One. This crisis lasted three years, from June 1921 to January 1924 when a new currency, the Rentenmark, was introduced.\n\nFrance had led the charge for Germany to pay massive war reparations as a punishment for the war, much to the dismay of John Maynard Keynes who explicitly warned that this would lead to economic collapse in Germany and a rise of extremist politics.\n\nUnable to pay the reparations in gold and also pay for services to its citizens, the Weimar Republic printed an excess of bank notes, causing a massive crash in the value of the German Mark. By the 1st November 1923 one pound of bread cost 3 billion Marks, one pound of meat 36 billion Marks and one glass of beer 4 billion Marks.\n\nHousehold wealth in the form of cash savings and bonds collapsed. Ownership of hard assets helped to offset some of the chaos, but not sufficiently to stop the rise of Hitler's National Socialist party.\n\nHyperinflation, defined as a monthly inflation rate of more than 50% per month, has occurred in many other countries during the 20th century. Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bolivia, Bosnia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Estonia, france, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Krajina, North Korea, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Yugoslavia, Zaire and Zimbabwe to name but a few.\n\nHyperinflation works well at wiping out the value of domestically held government debt. For example, if the UK government owed GBP 100 billion in pound sterling denominated debt it could decide to cause artificial inflation so that say a GBP 1.00 loaf of bread today cost GBP 1,000,000. This hyperinflation would make the GBP 100 billion pound debt the equivalent of GBP 1,000 in today's money.\n\nHowever, for countries in the Eurozone who cannot print their own money, it is almost impossible to inflate their way out of their debts. If they were to exit the euro they could choose to inflate domestic debts in their national currency to minimise debt, but would still have to pay their euro denominated debt, which would be very painful.\n\nHyperinflation presents an especially interesting dilemma for the United States today. The US has the ability to inflate their US denominated domestic debts into oblivion through the printing of massive quantities of money. As most of their foreign debt is also in US dollars, the act of inflating the US dollar would also wipe out US debts owed to foreigners.\n\nThere is a general view that this kind of currency manipulation is a bad thing and that the markets punish countries that are fiscally irresponsible. That may be true in the short term, but in the medium term the markets seem to be quite happy to continue lending money to countries that have previously seen both hyperinflation and those that have defaulted on their debts.\n\nCountries that have emerged from periods of hyperinflation, and their currency has become more reflective of its true value, this can help to make their economies more cost effective and competitive than they were previously.\n\nAdvocating that a country deliberately go through a period of hyperinflation or to force a debt jubilee appears irresponsible. However, the alternative is arguably not only worse but impossible to achieve: a crushing debt burden on societies and the consequent loss of all services that were previously paid for by taxation.\n\nFor conservative Christians this represents a fascinating dilemma - debt jubilees are both fiscally irresponsible but also biblically sanctioned.\n\nThis is an important question.\n\nRobotics and Slavery",

The trend causes a huge trade imbalance for the West, which helped to fuel the debt crisis. The practice has also created more global pollution as cleaner Western factories have been closed down and replaced by Asian factories powered by coal and producing 'dirtier' byproducts.\n\nFrom a Western perspective the main rationale for this form of outsourcing has been access to lower cost products. Once the practice had been adopted by a few companies to produce goods in places like China, which gave access to cheap land, cheap construction, and cheap labour, it became very difficult for other Western companies to compete. So they had to adapt as well.\n\nBut are these lower cost products really cheaper or is the low cost merely an illusion? We frequently think that something is cheaper than it really is: printer companies routinely sell customers good quality laser printers for GBP 100; an amazing price. But not so cheap when you discover that new ink cartridges can cost almost the same amount. Consumers are offered \"free\" mobile phones and then are tied in to 24-36 month contracts worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nHistory Future Now has looked at the cost of an imported product from a place like China and the impact of the 'cheap' products on higher levels of unemployment in Western societies. Some simple maths will show that the consumer may pay a low price for the imported product but this short term gain is offset by a much higher price. The cost is to fund fellow citizens who have no jobs and do not contribute taxes. It is important to look at the life cycle cost of products, not just the up front cost.\n\nLets have a closer look\n\nTo start with, lets admit it up front: many products that are built in China have a lower retail sales price than a competing product that is made somewhere in Europe.\n\nIf you add up the cost of cheaper land, cheaper buildings and cheaper labour, a GBP 100 laser printer imported from China may cost GBP 115 if it were built in the European Union or in the US. For people on a budget (most of us) this 15-20% increase in cost is a big deal. And when comparing nearly identical products, spending 15-20% more on a product just because it is made in your home country is not something that most people are willing (or able) to do.\n\nIf most of the growth in manufacturing and service sector jobs is in Asia, albeit to provide goods and services for people in the West, then the result is that there are fewer jobs in the West. Despite the efforts of economists to play down this issue, citing theories of comparative advantage, the reality is that unemployment in the West is a natural consequence of outsourcing. Under employment, is another major problem in the West as skilled jobs become scarce and people are overqualified for the jobs they are forced into doing.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, which provides statistics for the European Commission, the European Union 17 (those in the Euro-zone) had an average unemployment rate of 12.1% for all people of working age population in October 2013. Given the fact that Germany is the largest country in the EU17 and has an exceptionally low level of 5.2% the average for the EU17 excluding Germany is much higher. Greece and Spain, for example, have an unemployment rate of 27.3% and 26.7% respectively.\n\nRicardian theory of comparative advantage does not seem to be working any longer and, (See P-) possibly never worked in the past. If the theory worked in practice significantly lower levels of unemployment would be seen across the European Union as each worker would do the job to which they are best suited.\n\nSo lets get back on track.\n\nWhat is the cost of this unemployment on society? There are lots of ways of looking at it. We will take the most simplistic way, as it is should be less controversial, although it is likely to understate the true cost quite considerably.\n\nLets make a series of assumptions, based on the UK's economy. The average income is GBP 26,600 per annum, or GBP 2,217 per month. Of that 24% is taxed, resulting in a take home salary of GBP 20,216 per annum or GBP 1,685 per month. The critical part here is the amount of Income Tax: GBP 6,384. The actual amount deducted as tax is higher than this figure as companies pay Employer's National Insurance on top, but we will ignore it.\n\nIf you are unemployed in the UK the maximum amount you can get in benefits (from 2014) including housing and income support, is GBP 26,000. Curiously some of that is subject to tax. Thus if you do not work and depend on the State the full cost of those benefits to the government (i.e. taxpayers) is GBP 27,184. This is sum the total of benefits paid by the government to the citizen plus the cost of missed taxes not paid by the citizen to the government.\n\nIn the UK of a population of 64m people there are 33m people of working age. Of the working age population 2.5m are unemployed (7.6%). This results in a theoretical unemployment cost of GBP 67 billion per annum (2.5m x GBP 27k per annum). That means that of the 30m people in Britain who are working GBP 2,236 of the GBP 6,384 they pay in taxes (35%) goes to pay for those that are unemployed. That is a lot.\n\nIf, miraculously, there was no unemployment and that proportion of tax was returned to the working population, each would, theoretically, have an additional GBP 2,236 per year to spend on whatever they wanted. That is the equivalent of 1.3 months of additional salary per year. Returning to the laser printer example, it costs GBP 115 to build in the EU but GBP 100 to import from China. A GBP 15 difference. If the sole reason for EU unemployment is attributed to cheaper labour in China (which is an exaggeration) and if there was zero EU unemployment each worker could buy the labour only equivalent of 149 laser printers per year (149 x GBP 15 = GBP 2,236) from the EU rather than China without busting their personal budget. That is a lot of manufactured goods.\n\nUsing the same assumptions, but switching the unemployment rate to 12.1%, which is the average rate for the EU17, it would cost the UK GBP 107bn (vs GBP 67bn) to pay benefits to unemployed people. Thus 59% of all the personal income tax that employed people pay (GBP 3,742 of GBP 6,384) would be needed to pay for people that are unemployed. That is equivalent to 2.2 months of additional income per year.\n\nIt gets worse if you use Greece's unemployment rate of 27.3%. If the UK had this level of unemployment, 8.9 million out of the 32.6m working age population would have no job. It would cost taxpayers GBP 10,208 per year (GBP 242 billion) to foot the bill for the unemployed - a sum which is higher than the GBP 6,384 in tax an average worker currently pays. The cost to each worker for each non-worker would be equivalent to 6 months additional income per year. That is the equivalent of a huge number of low cost goods from China.\n\nThe UK's total budget for 2012-2013 was GBP 683bn so the cost of supporting unemployment at the current Greek level would devastate the UK's budget. At GBP 242 billion the cost of unemployment is only a little less than all the money spent on defense (GBP 39 billion), education (GBP 91 billion) and health (GBP 130 billion) put together.\n\nWhat is alarming is that youth unemployment in the European Union is significantly higher than total unemployment. The chart below shows the average youth unemployment rate for the EU as a whole and in the EU17 (Eurozone) in particular.\n\nIf you are young it is very hard to find a job. And if you can't find a job now you are less likely to find a well paid job in the future. This means that over time unemployment rates are likely to go up, not down.\n\nThese statistics show that the cost to society for unemployed people is likely to go up over time, resulting in permanently overstretched budgets and/or increased government borrowing. Alternatively unemployment benefits could be slashed. This solution would be likely to result in an increased budget requirement for law enforcement to control increasingly desperate people who would resort to crime to help make ends meet. More prisons would be needed to house all of those \"undesirable\" people at an additional cost.\n\nSo sure, a consumable product or service may be 10-15% cheaper using outsourced labour. But by focusing on the low cost of the product and ignoring the actual cost to us as an individual taxpayer we are fooling ourselves. It is exactly the same mindset that tricks people into buying cheap laser jet printers only to find that they require absurdly expensive ink cartridges, or into buying a product with a credit card without considering the resultant cost of an extra 27% interest per annum to your credit card company.\n\nBy examining the life-cycle cost this way it is clear that the cost of high levels of unemployment is more expensive to a citizen than the benefit of importing lower priced products.\n\nA final note.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the underlying cost of cheap versus the cost of high unemployment levels.\n\nIn the chapter Why do we need the military? we examine the cost of securing energy supplies and trade. The US spends $137 billion per year on its military in the Pacific, mainly on its navy, to secure open access of the Pacific and Indian Ocean to support commerce. But the US loses a huge amount every year in trade to Asian countries: $295 billion per year to China, $63 billion to Japan, $13 billion to South Korea, $15 billion to Taiwan and $14 billion to India, a total of $400 billion per year. This annual transfer of wealth, plus the military cost of transferring this wealth, amounts to a staggering $537 billion per year for the US and is the equivalent of $1,700 per American man, woman and child. This budget busting spending has contributed to the US's mindboggling private, commercial and government debt, all of which needs to be paid for at some point.\n\nIt is easy to understand why multinational companies are more than happy with outsourcing employment. Corporations need to compete with each other for market share, profit margins, customers etc. Getting your products to market cheaper by undercutting your competitor is likely to result in more sales. Companies don't want to worry about the external costs to society of their actions. - High unemployment, increased pollution, workers conditions are issues for the Government. As for paying taxes - especially when Corporations actively see themselves as transcending the nationality of their original home country - this is viewed solely as a cost to the bottom line not as a social obligation.\n\nIt is also easy to understand why individuals in the West are happy with the status quo. We can buy cheaper imported goods and services. And it is hard to make an explicit connection between the higher taxes and higher unemployment levels that result from it.\n\nHowever, it is a real mystery as to why so many Western politicians and economists promote a trading system that increases Western unemployment levels and results in a gigantic transfer of wealth to the East every year.\n\nThey ought to know better.\n\nWhy Buying Cheap Imported Products Is More Expensive For Individuals And Not Just Society",

      "full_text": "Despite the fact that both John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich August Hayek are dead, their ideas are very much alive today and form the basis of whether governments choose austerity or stimulus as a way out of our current economic crisis.\n\nBoth men were brilliant and arguably had people listened to their opinions before the Great Depression that started in 1929, the Depression and the Second World War would not have happened. Modern politicians are listening to their opinions now in the hope of preventing our Great Recession from turning into a second Great Depression. This is a mistake.\n\nBefore History Future Now explains why it is a mistake, it would be useful to provide a very quick primer on who these men were and an elevator pitch on their policies.\n\nFriedrich August Hayek\n\nHayek was born in Vienna in 1899, while it was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. He died in Freiburg Germany aged 92, in 1992, having seen the First World War, the rise of communism in Russia, the boom of the 1920s, the Great Depression, the rise of Hitler and the Second World War, the Cold War and the end of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter a stint as an artillery spotter on the Italian front in WW1 he ended up in the late 1920s as the founder and director of the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research, where he wrote pretty dry papers on economics. One thing that he did write of note was a prediction of the great Wall Street Crash in late 1929 by arguing that low interest rates fixed by the Federal Reserve Bank (then a relatively new institution) encouraged speculative borrowing on property and on the stock market. He later joined the LSE in London, became a British citizen, and wrote his classic book \"The Road to Serfdom\", which was published in 1944.\n\nContrary to the belief of many conservatives today, Hayek did think that government had a role to play in the monetary system, how labour laws were governed, freedom of information and that it should provide some form of social safety net - including mandatory universal health care and unemployment insurance. But that was about it.\n\nHe particularly disliked government intervention in anything that would promote one industry over anything else and really disliked the use of interest rates to manipulate a currency . He believed that artificially low interest rates were likely to cause bubbles. The best way to stop economic crashes was to stop the bubble from emerging in the first place.\n\nSince governments like boom periods, as it makes them more likely to be reelected, it was always going to be tempting for a government to keep interest rates low to encourage borrowing and thus growth. It is for this reason that so many conservatives are attracted to his theories today: our boom since the 1990s has been based on generally low interest levels which have fuelled a huge bubble in property and stocks. Has we listened to Hayek we might not have been in this mess.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n\nKeynes was older than Hayek and was born in Cambridge in 1883, at the height of the British Empire. He died young, 62 years later in 1946. Wildly considered a genius and intimidating to talk with, he generally an optimist, perhaps linked to a happy childhood and thought that all problems could be solved if you worked hard enough at them, something that he picked up from Eton and Cambridge.\n\nAt the start of the First World War he joined the British Treasury. It was his work at the Versailles Conference, however, which really set him apart as a visionary. He tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade the French and British governments not to impose huge war reparations on Germany and Austria as a punishment for the war. He argued that this would destabilise the country and would eventually result in a new war. He wrote in The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919 that:\n\nThe policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable,-abhorrent and detestable, even if it were possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilised life of Europe.\n\nAnd that:\n\nIf we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing.\n\nWhilst it was his views about reparations that showed him to be a visionary during his lifetime, it was his views about the role of government intervention in an economy that make him so influential today, 66 years after his death.\n\nHe argued that to stop the unemployment crisis of the 1920s in Britain the UK should depreciate the pound sterling and go off the gold standard to make British exports more competitive. He also argued that the government could stimulate the economy by borrowing now to pay for public works today. He was not particularly bothered where the money was spent - it was the act of spending that would stimulate the economy and get people working again, through the concept of the multiplier effect.\n\nIn 1933, as the Great Depression was at its peak, he wrote a book called The Means to Prosperity which detailed his thoughts. Sweden and Germany picked up on his ideas and Hitler's use of public spending to get Germans back to work was ultimately very successful and embarrassing at the same time.\n\nThe US also underwent stimulus measures, but it was arguably the Second World War which proved that huge government spending could pull an economy out of a recession. Big government was now popular and many in the UK took on Keynes' idea of government spending to an extreme that he had not envisaged: spending not to get out of a recession but just spending all the time.\n\nKeynes early death in 1946 meant that his ideas could not be refreshed by the man himself and by the late 1970s he was widely discredited. Thatcher and Reagan were great lovers of Hayek. They saw government as the problem, not the solution, and called for the rapid retreat of government from the economy. Deregulation and privatisation were their calls to arms.\n\nSince the 2008 crisis, however, governments have jumped back onto the Keynes bandwagon with great enthusiasm: the combination of currency devaluation (quantative easing or printing money) and huge public spending are policies that Keynes had advocated in order to get ourselves out of the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n\nSumming up their positions\n\nSo, to sum up their two positions:\n\nHayek thought that government meddling, such as in the form of low interest rates, was the cause of bubbles and that bubbles ultimately resulted in crashes once people, companies and governments realised that they had become unsustainably large. It is hard to argue with that.\n\nKeynes thought that once you had a recession workers would not willingly reduce their cost of labour (they had fixed costs of their own - like housing and food) and so the only way you could rapidly pull your country out of a recession was to borrow money to pay for public works that would stimulate demand. The general feeling of well being that resulted from that would then encourage workers to spend money on other activities (the multiplier effect) which would then generate more demand, and more feelings of well being. Once demand had been sufficiently primed, the government's need to stimulate the economy would recede and increased tax revenues from the primed economy would then pay off the debt that had just been accumulated for the stimulus. It is hard to argue with that either.\n\nSo why are they both wrong?\n\nThe policies that both Hayek and Keynes proscribed do not work in our historical period and context. As such, they are wrong and political leaders are wrong to rely on solutions that might have worked when they were thought up over 80 years ago.\n\nHayek's problem is that his solution does nothing to get us out of our current predicament. When the US investment banking sector imploded in 2008 Hayek's position would have been to do absolutely nothing.\n\nIt is galling to see investment bankers make so much money in good times, and the fact that their losses were taken over by the general public through bailouts makes the system doubly unjust. Private sector profit and public sector losses. That seems a prescription for gambling and Hayek would have criticised this and rightly so.\n\nBut doing nothing had the real possibility of creating a financial domino effect where even well run, conservatively managed companies would have been forced into bankruptcy as people who owed them money were unable to pay and as banks called in their loans. The possibility of the entire economy being wrecked was real.\n\nHayek's usefulness is in providing us guidance about how to reduce the likelihood of future booms, and thus eventual busts. But even here he is in a weak position. Voters like to see their politicians \"do something\" and solve problems. Politicians like \"doing something\" as well as it justifies their existence. In the US, electoral campaign funding by the private sector requires politicians to \"do something.\" The chances of a political system allowing little government intervention is thus low.\n\nKeynes' policies do try to provide a solution to the problem of the Great Recession. He is offering more than Hayek in that regard. But while Hayek's policies might have stopped us from getting into the situation we are now in, Keynes' solution does not work for the West today. The main reasons for this is due to demographic, environmental and balance of power changes.\n\nKeynes grew up in a world in which there were just over 1.5 billion people. By 1930 there were 2 billion people. Today there are over 7 billion people. In 38 years there will be 10 billion people. The good thing about an increase in population normally is that people stimulate the economy, and more people are able to pay of debts faster than fewer people.\n\nBut in the West, this demographic bonanza does not exist. Most European countries have birth rates that are well below replacement levels. The financial crisis is likely to exasperate this as women hold off having children. In addition, the population of the West is much older than when Keynes was alive. He died aged 62. This was not unusual for his time, but is very young today. What this means is that societies in the West have increasingly large numbers of adults that are retired and of pensionable age. They contribute little in terms of taxes but take out significant sums from the economy in the form of pensions and medical care.\n\nSimultaneous to this, the number of young people in employment has dropped significantly. Due to educational aspirations set in the 1980s and onwards, more young people are in higher education. This means that they contribute little in terms of taxes but take out a significant amount in terms of education and maintenance support. Theoretically, once they have graduated they should be able to get higher wages, resulting in higher tax receipts. However, youth unemployment is over 25% across the European Union on average, with rates of over 50% in Greece and Spain and over 30% in 1o EU countries. Unemployment rates for university graduates are also very high.\n\nSo unlike for Keynes, who could count on a growing young population and a small old population, the West today has a shrinking overall population, a growing older population and an economically crippled younger population. This is a problem for Keynesian macro economic theory. As the West borrows more money for one stimulus package after another the overall debt level and interest levels rise. This debt burden then falls onto a population that is demographically unable to pay the debt down.\n\nThe second issue is environmental. Born in 1883, Keynes lived in a world of expanding material wealth with resources that were being unlocked from the earth after being hidden away since creation: coal, oil, gas, minerals, forests and new agricultural land were being opened up. New technologies expanded productivity of farming on land and new fishing vessels brought in catches from the deep blue oceans. Had he lived a few more years he would have been able to see a world of passenger jets that could bring cargoes of fresh fruit and flowers from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere.\n\nToday the opposite is true in nearly every respect. We are living in an environmentally constricting world. Oil and gas have either peaked or are about to peak, before they enter their long downwards slide. Farming productivity has shrunk, despite ever increasing amounts of oil and fertiliser inputs. Grand irrigation programmes that unlocked the great plains of the Mid West in the US are facing extinction as the underground aquifer water runs out over the next 25 years. Our forests have been cut and ploughed over. Global fish stocks have dropped over 80%. Global warming will exasperate and accelerate these environmental problems.\n\nThe reason why this is an issue is that it is much harder to grow when your resources are declining. The adage that \"a rising tide lifts all boats\" is also true of the economy. With a resource boom, it is easier to pay off your debts at a later stage. But as the tide goes down, as our resources decline, the opposite is also true.\n\nFinally, the balance of power of the world is radically different. When Keynes and Hayek were growing up Western powers utterly dominated the world. There were struggles, but all the struggles were between Western powers. The West not only dominated in manufacturing - forcing the non western world to buy their goods - but also dominated in resources - its imperial colonies providing the raw materials for the West's consumption. This dominance created great wealth and jobs.\n\nThe end of the Cold War opened up the non aligned world to trade. In the same way that the US had blossomed economically out of the rubble of post Second World War Europe, dominating in a way that it had been unable to before the War, the West blossomed after the end of the Cold War, rushing into markets in Eastern Europe, India and China. But this opening up also awakened economic spirits that had lain dormant for hundreds of years.\n\nTrillions of dollars of investment flowed into new emerging markets. New roads, bridges, ports, power stations and factories were built. New schools and universities churned out thousands of well educated and keen workers. Western media showed these people of the lives that they could aspire to once they grew economically.\n\nAnd so they did. And in doing so they started to pull in the jobs that once had been done by Western workers by the millions. First they peeled away low end manufacturing jobs. The West was happy to lose them - they were dirty and undesirable. Then they peeled away mid level jobs. The West was still ambivalent, but getting concerned. Then they peeled away high technology jobs, from aircraft manufacturing and high speed rail to solar photovoltaics and wind turbines.\n\nWhich causes an additional problem for Keynesian economics. Countries borrow today in order to stimulate an economy so that domestic workers feel more confident. They then spend more money, which makes other domestic workers feel more confident. Eventually the economy is sufficiently confident that the stimulus can be removed and increased taxes can pay the debt that was incurred in stimulating the economy.\n\nAnd this is the problem. The stimulus money may provide more cash. But will the cash be spent on Western products, or will it be used to buy cheaper products from abroad? In a recession companies are likely to want to keep costs down, prompting them to buy cheaper products from abroad. That means that the stimulus cash is not making western workers feel more confident. They then spend less, not more, either because they have no job - it has been outsourced - or they save, wondering if they will lose their job to outsourcing next. Thus the stimulus package can get bigger and bigger, without any impact on the domestic economy - this is why we are getting a jobless recovery.\n\nAt some point, the borrowing has to stop. The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that by 2025 US interest payments on debt combined with Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will be so large that they will theoretically consume 100% of all federal tax income receipts. That is only 13 years from now.\n\nSo if Keynes and Hayek are wrong, what should we do?\n\nFuture History Now has started to offer solutions and has written about many of them. Here are three:\n\nTo get our debt levels down, we need to go through a period of inflation. That makes the absolute amount of debt relatively easier to pay. Inflation can be managed by printing money. Unlike the Germans and Austrians after the First World War who did not really understand the consequences of uncontrolled printing of money and its likelihood of causing destabilising hyperinflation, we do. We should be able to inflate just enough to speed up the reduction of debts to manageable levels without going into a hyperinflation nightmare. The advantage of inflation over debt defaults is that the accounts add up and you dont need to take write downs which can have destabilising impacts on the economy.\n\nGlobal free trade should be abandoned, replaced by regional free trade within regions of similar economies. If you want to sell products into those regions you would need to create factories and jobs in those regions. Trade between regions should be allowed, encouraged, but controlled. This achieves two objectives. First, any stimulus money that is paid for by the government, and thus taxpayers, gets spent in country (or at least in region). This means that the jobs that the stimulus funds generate get created in country, contributing to a sense of well being, making citizens spend more, in country, creating more jobs in country and thus increasing the tax base required to pay off any debt. Second, it forces companies outside the region to relocate their factories and service jobs within your region if they want to be able to sell to you. This creates jobs in region directly and also jobs indirectly as service jobs are created to support the activities of the factories. China actively pursues this policy already, to the benefit of its citizens. We should follow their lead.\n\nWe should stop exporting cash overseas unnecessarily. The US has a trade deficit of over $400 billion per year with China, India, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea alone. It spends an additional $137 billion per year on its Pacific fleet, which is mainly used for ensuring freedom of the seas between the same countries with whom it has a $400 billion trade deficit. In the Middle East, the US spends $235 billion per year on average on its Persian Gulf fleet and has spent an additional $2.6 trillion between 2001 and 2010 on military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has done this to support the oil that it imports from the region, which only adds up to 19% of its imports but costs more than 2.5 times the remaining 81% of its imports. If the US were to spend its budget on the Persian Gulf fleet on solar photovoltaics at home, it could provide free electricity equivalent to the entire electricity consumption of the United States every year. This would support hundreds of thousands of jobs at in the US.\n\nKeynes and Hayek were brilliant men and gifted thinkers. Their policies, had they been listened to, might have prevented the rise of Hitler (Keynes) and stopped boom and busts (Hayek). But they are dead. And the era in which they lived and that they thought about is over as well. Had they been alive today they would have adapted their thoughts to fit with the new reality.\n\nOur politicians must stop thinking of them as Gods, enlightened beings that they should listen to blindly. Politicians should understand that the world has changed and that they need to adapt their policies accordingly.\n\nDebt Jubilees And Hyperinflation - Why History Shows That This Might Be The Way Forward For Us All",

We will explore how the influx of slave labor transformed these societies, creating new forms of social stratification and economic inequality, and how the practice of individuals selling themselves into slavery to escape poverty or debt foreshadows the potential risks of widespread adoption of robots.\n\nNext, we will turn to the modern phenomenon of mass migration and its similarities to the dynamics of slavery and robotics. We will examine how the desire for cheap, exploitable labor has driven both the historical slave trade and contemporary patterns of global migration, and how the influx of immigrant workers has transformed economies and societies around the world.\n\nWe then look at the potential impacts of humanoid robots on the future of work and inequality. We will explore how the integration of these technologies into the workforce could lead to widespread job displacement and social upheaval, particularly for low-skilled workers and immigrant communities.\n\nFrom there, we consider the role of robots in the future of space exploration and colonisation. We may think that this is the dawn of a beautiful relationship between robots and humans but the reality is that robots will be better at this than humans.\n\nHumanoid robots are coming and we are not going to be able to stop them. This article helps to paint a picture as to what life will be like. Most people won't find it pretty.\n\nPart 1: The Advent of Humanoid Robots\n\nThe field of humanoid robotics has made remarkable strides in recent years, bringing us closer to a future where robots coexist alongside humans in various aspects of life.\n\nIn Part 1 we are just going to introduce some of the leading companies in this space. The list is not exhaustive and new companies are emerging all the time, demonstrating a rich ecosystem of individuals, companies and investors. Most companies are focusing on entire robots while others are focused on individual components such as facial expressions, hands or AI based operating systems. The aim is simply to show that humanoid robots are significantly more advanced than most people realise, they are improving rapidly every few months, and they will be commercially viable faster than you imagine.\n\nBy the time you read this article some of the companies will have failed, been acquired or fallen by the wayside. New companies will have emerged. But ultimately we are moving rapidly to a general purpose humanoid robot that fills most of our science fiction fantasies at a price point that is the equivalent of a family car. It is these two final components that are critical. They need to be fully versatile and cheap enough to be affordable as a mass market invention. Given what they are - a relatively low weight series of electric motors on a chassis with a battery pack, sensors, a GPU processor and an operating system- there is no reason for them not to be the price of a family car once produced at scale.\n\nWith that beings said here are some of the leading players:\n\nBoston Dynamics , is the grand-daddy in the field of robotics and continues to push the envelope with its Atlas humanoid robot. It is very impressive and can do stunts that most humans cannot do. Although Atlas may not fall under the $50,000 price point in the near future, its advanced agility, strength, and dexterity make it a benchmark for humanoid robot capabilities. From parkour skills and backflips to navigating complex terrain and performing delicate tasks, Atlas showcases the cutting edge of humanoid robotic movement. Boston Dynamics has been on this path for a long time and it is ahead of most. But new companies have emerged since 2022 that have made impressive progress and may end up eclipsing Boston Dynamics.\n\nTesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, is another notable contender in the field. Optimus is designed to perform a wide range of tasks in factories and homes. Tesla is relatively new to the field but has made huge advances in 2023-2024. By leveraging Tesla's expertise in AI and electric motors, Optimus aims to achieve smooth and efficient movement at a target price point below $20,000, making it a strong candidate for widespread adoption. Musk has also demonstrated that he understands the challenges of mass production, which is a big advantage over other companies in this space. As with cars, the Tesla robot is vertically integrated with most of the components including software done in house.\n\nFigure.ai's Figure 01 robot is a general-purpose, AI-powered humanoid designed for diverse applications in manufacturing, logistics, and beyond. With a focus on affordability and versatility, Figure 01 is intended to be self-reliant and capable of working alongside humans in various tasks. Its human-like form factor allows for seamless integration with existing infrastructure, making it a promising alternative to the single-function robots mainly used in industry today. They have done a deal with OpenAI which has resulted in some remarkable videos of it operating and talking to people.\n\nEngineered Arts' Ameca robot is different and pushes the boundaries of human-like appearance and interaction. With its incredibly realistic facial expressions and detailed hands, Ameca represents a significant step forward in human-robot interaction. Ameca's lifelike features show how we can expect more natural and intuitive communication between humans and robots.\n\nUnitree H1 is another impressive humanoid robot, focusing on power and athleticism. It is likely that Chinese companies will end up dominating this field and there are a lot of overlaps with electric car manufacturing, where Chinese companies already dominate. Holding the record for the fastest bipedal robot at 3.3 meters per second, the Unitree H1 demonstrates remarkable strength and dynamic movements. Its impressive athletic capabilities (it can do backflips) position it as a strong candidate for tasks requiring both speed and power, while still being expected to be around $90,000.\n\nFinally NVIDIA , the chipmaker behind most of the AI systems around the world, has announced it is developing an operating system and chipset specifically for humanoid robots. This is an important innovation as many companies, such as Boston Dynamics, are clearly able to build sophisticated hardware but may not be able to develop the brains at the same time. NVIDIA aims to be the Microsoft and Intel of the robot world.\n\nThe progress made by these companies and their respective humanoid robots highlights the rapid pace of development in this field. As these technologies continue to advance and become more affordable, the potential for widespread adoption grows, promising to revolutionize industries and transform the way we live and work.\n\nHowever, the integration of humanoid robots into society also raises important questions and concerns. As these machines become more capable and autonomous, their impact on the job market, social dynamics, and human interactions will be significant. The ethical implications of creating robots that closely resemble humans and the potential for these technologies to exacerbate existing inequalities must also be carefully considered.\n\nWe now move onto Part 2, looking back to the last time we had a cheap general purpose humanoid labour force. We called them slaves.\n\nPart 2: The Shadows of Slavery\n\nTo fully comprehend the potential implications of humanoid robots on society, it is essential to delve into the historical institution of slavery and its profound impact on ancient civilizations such as Greece, Rome, and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBy examining the parallels between slavery and the integration of advanced robotics into the workforce, we can gain valuable insights into the potential risks and challenges that lie ahead.\n\nIn ancient Greece, slavery was a widespread and deeply entrenched practice. Slaves were considered the property of their owners and had no legal rights or protections. They were acquired through various means, including conquest, piracy, and trade with other societies. The city-state of Athens, renowned for its cultural and intellectual achievements, had an exceptionally high proportion of slaves, with estimates suggesting that they outnumbered free citizens.\n\nThe treatment of slaves in ancient Greece varied widely, depending on factors such as the individual owner and the specific role of the slave. Some slaves were subjected to brutal and inhumane conditions, forced to work in dangerous mines or toil in the fields under the scorching sun. Others, particularly those with specialized skills or knowledge, held more privileged positions within households or businesses. These slaves might serve as tutors, artisans, or even trusted advisors to their owners.\n\nIn ancient Rome, slavery was an integral part of the social and economic fabric. The Roman Empire's vast, multi century, territorial expansions brought a constant influx of slaves from conquered lands, with estimates suggesting that up to 40% of the population in Italy were enslaved during the late Republic. Slaves in Rome were considered property under the law, with no legal personhood or rights.\n\nThe conditions faced by Roman slaves were often brutal and dehumanizing. They could be subjected to severe physical punishment, sexual exploitation, and forced labor in mines, farms, and households. However, some slaves managed to attain positions of relative privilege and autonomy, particularly those with valuable skills or knowledge. For example, educated Greek slaves were highly prized by wealthy Roman families and could sometimes secure better treatment and even their freedom. This latter group could run complex international business empires on behalf of their masters and commanded a great deal of respect and authority.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire also relied heavily on slave labor. Slavery was a central pillar of Ottoman society and economy for centuries, with slaves acquired through conquest, tribute, and the devşirme system, which involved the forcible recruitment of Christian boys from conquered territories.\n\nSlaves in the Ottoman Empire served in various roles, including as soldiers in the elite Janissary corps, bureaucrats in the imperial administration, and domestic servants in wealthy households. The conditions faced by Ottoman slaves varied widely, with some enduring harsh treatment and exploitation, while others managed to attain positions of power and influence within the imperial hierarchy.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of slavery in these ancient societies was the practice of individuals voluntarily selling themselves into servitude. This is an important concept for History Future Now readers to comprehend and we will return to this concept later in the article.\n\nIn ancient Greece, it was not uncommon for impoverished individuals to sell themselves into slavery to escape debt or provide for their families. The Greek philosopher Diogenes, for example, was said to have been captured by pirates and sold into slavery, but he later gained his freedom and went on to become a renowned thinker.\n\nSimilarly, in ancient Rome, some individuals willingly sold themselves into slavery to gain access to the households of wealthy and influential families. This was particularly true for educated Greeks, who saw slavery as a means of social mobility and a path to eventual freedom and citizenship. The playwright Plautus, for instance, sold himself into slavery to pay off his debts, but he later gained his freedom and went on to become one of the most celebrated writers of Roman comedy.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire, the practice of impoverished individuals voluntarily selling themselves or their children into slavery was also prevalent, particularly during times of famine or economic hardship. Some parents saw slavery as a means of ensuring their children's survival and potentially securing a better future for them within the households of the wealthy and powerful. Some slaves rose to powerful positions, demonstrating the potential for social mobility within the system. One notable example is Shajar al-Durr, a slave-concubine who became the first female Muslim ruler of Egypt in 1250. The mamlūks, an Arabic word for \"owned,\" were trained as soldiers and rose to leadership positions upon completion of their training, becoming clients with continuing obligations to their former masters.\n\nThe institution of slavery had a corrosive effect on the moral and ethical foundations of these societies. The dehumanization and exploitation of slaves were often justified through elaborate legal and philosophical frameworks that sought to legitimize the practice. This, in turn, created a culture of inequality and oppression that permeated all aspects of social and political life.\n\nAs we anticipate the rise of humanoid robots and their potential impact on our own society, it is crucial to recognise the parallels between these advanced machines and the historical institution of slavery. Robots are not sentient beings and cannot suffer in the same way that human slaves did. However, their integration into the workforce raises similar questions about the displacement of human labor, the concentration of wealth and power, and the ethical implications of creating a class of entities designed solely to serve the needs and desires of their owners.\n\nIn addition, the practice of individuals voluntarily selling themselves into slavery in ancient societies raises troubling questions about the potential impact of widespread automation on the most vulnerable members of our own society. Like in Greece, Rome and the Ottoman Empire, we should expect that people will opt to sell themselves into slavery in order to pay off debts or to try to move up the social ladder. There are already parallels in rich Middle Eastern countries today where south Asians are brought in to work to pay off debts and end up having their passports confiscated and restrictions placed on them. These 'meat based' humanoid workers may become status symbols in an era of cheap, incredibly capable robots. They may be integrated into households alongside humanoid robots in the same way that an educated Greek who has sold himself into slavery to pay of debts would integrate into a household with large Gaulish tribesmen captured in battle.\n\nPart 3: The Echoes of Mass Migration\n\nThe next important concept to acknowledge is the harsh reality that mass migration of poorer people into western societies is not that different from the mass capture of slaves that were integrated into the Roman and Ottoman empires. They are not slaves but they share many characteristics and occupy the same economic and labour niche. As such they are a precursor of what may yet happen.\n\nIn the modern era, the phenomenon of mass migration shares striking similarities with the historical institution of slavery, particularly in terms of the economic and social impact on host societies. While migrants are not subjected to the same level of legal and physical coercion as slaves, they often find themselves in positions of vulnerability and exploitation, driven by economic necessity to seek opportunities in foreign lands.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples of mass migration in recent history is the movement of workers from Mexico and Central America to the United States. These migrants, often fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries, have played a crucial role in the American economy, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, construction, and service industries. Interestingly, they are smaller and look physically different to most of the European heritage Americans that employ them, in the same way that African slaves looked different to European and Jewish descent slave owners in the American South. This helps make them 'others,' blinding people to the realities of their lot in life.\n\nIn the agricultural sector, for instance, migrant workers from Mexico and Central America already make up a significant portion of the workforce. According to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 70% of hired farmworkers in the United States are foreign-born, with the vast majority of them being Mesoanericans coming from Mexico and Central America. These workers often face grueling conditions, with long hours, low pay, and exposure to hazardous chemicals and extreme weather conditions.\n\nDespite their essential role in the American economy, migrant farmworkers are often denied basic labor protections and benefits, such as minimum wage, overtime pay, and workers' compensation. Many are also subjected to wage theft, harassment, and abuse by their employers, who take advantage of their vulnerable status and fear of deportation.\n\nIn the construction industry, migrant workers from Latin America have also played a significant role, particularly in states such as California, Texas, and Florida. According to a report by the National Association of Home Builders, immigrants make up nearly a quarter of the construction workforce in the United States, with many coming from Mexico and other Latin American countries.\n\nLike migrant farmworkers, construction workers often face dangerous working conditions, with high rates of injury and fatality on the job. They are also vulnerable to exploitation by employers, who may misclassify them as independent contractors to avoid paying benefits and taxes, or withhold wages altogether.\n\nThe impact of mass migration on the American economy has been significant, with both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, migrant workers have helped to fill crucial labor shortages in industries such as agriculture and construction, and have contributed to the growth and prosperity of the American economy as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand, the influx of low-wage migrant labor has also had a negative impact on wages and working conditions for native-born workers, particularly those in low-skilled occupations. This has led to social and political tensions as mass migration has undermined the bargaining power of American workers and contributed to the erosion of the middle class.\n\nThe parallels between mass migration and the institution of slavery are particularly striking when one considers the role of economic coercion in driving both phenomena. Just as slaves in ancient societies were often compelled to sell themselves into bondage to escape poverty or debt, many modern-day migrants are driven by economic necessity to leave their homes and families behind in search of better opportunities abroad.\n\nThis economic coercion is often reinforced by a range of other factors, such as political instability, violence, and environmental degradation in migrants' home countries. In Central America, for example, decades of civil war, gang violence, and natural disasters have created a perfect storm of push factors, driving millions of people to seek refuge and opportunity in the United States and other countries.\n\nAt the same time, the demand for cheap, exploitable labor in host countries such as the United States has created a powerful pull factor, drawing migrants across borders in search of work. This demand is often fueled by the same kinds of economic and political interests that drove the slave trade in centuries past, with employers and industries seeking to maximise profits by minimising labor costs.\n\nThe result is a system that, while not legally codified in the same way as slavery, nonetheless shares many of its essential features. Like slaves, migrant workers are often treated as disposable commodities, valued only for their labor and subject to exploitation and abuse by those in positions of power.\n\nThis exploitation takes many forms, from the physical and sexual abuse of migrant women in domestic and agricultural work, to the wage theft and unsafe working conditions faced by migrant men in construction and other industries. It is a system that, like slavery, is built on a foundation of inequality and coercion, with the most vulnerable members of society bearing the heaviest burden.\n\nOf course, there are important differences between the institution of slavery and the modern phenomenon of mass migration. Unlike slaves, migrant workers are not legally owned by their employers and are theoretically free to leave their jobs and return home. In practice, however, many migrants find themselves trapped in a cycle of debt and exploitation, unable to escape the conditions that drove them to migrate in the first place.\n\nMoreover, while slavery was a legally sanctioned institution in many ancient societies, the exploitation of migrant workers today is often carried out in violation of national and international laws. This has led to calls for greater regulation and enforcement of labor standards, as well as for more humane and equitable immigration policies that prioritize the rights and well-being of migrants.\n\nDespite these differences, however, the parallels between slavery and mass migration remain striking. Robots are going to blur the boundaries even further.\n\nPart 4: The Rise of the Planet of Robots\n\nThe widespread adoption of humanoid robots and advanced AI systems will have a profound impact on society, fundamentally transforming the nature of work, social relationships, and the very fabric of our daily lives. As robots become increasingly capable and affordable, they will reshape the economy, politics, and culture in ways that are both exciting and deeply unsettling.\n\nOne of the most immediate and devastating impacts of the rise of robots will be on employment. As machines become capable of performing an ever-wider range of tasks, millions of jobs across virtually every sector of the economy will be at risk of automation. According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, as many as 800 million jobs worldwide could be automated by 2030, with low-skilled and low-wage workers being the most vulnerable to displacement. In the United States alone, it is estimated that up to 47% of jobs are at risk of being automated in the coming decades, with sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and transportation being particularly vulnerable. These numbers are so huge that they are difficult to imagine. Try visualising this: two people standing next to each other, shoulder to shoulder with no gaps. 800 million people standing shoulder to shoulder is the equivalent of a line that would wrap around the entire equatorial circumference of the Earth (40,075 km) almost 10 times or is almost the distance from the Earth to the Moon. That is a lot of people who are going to end up unemployed or underemployed.\n\nThe impact of this job displacement will be particularly acute for low-skilled and low-wage workers, who are already vulnerable to exploitation and marginalization. In sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture, where industrial (not humanoid) robots are already being deployed at scale, the introduction of even more advanced machines could lead to the wholesale elimination of entire occupations and industries, leaving millions of workers without a means of supporting themselves and their families. This will also have a significant impact on the migrant workers discussed above, who often rely on these types of jobs for their livelihood. As robots begin to compete with migrants for roles in farms, factories, and domestic service, we can expect to see growing tensions and potentially even backlash in the form of robot destruction.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the mundane and repetitive tasks that robots are likely to take over are not just a source of income for many people, but also a fundamental part of their sense of purpose and identity. The feeling of being a useful contributor to one's family and society is essential for psychological well-being, and the loss of this sense of purpose could lead to widespread feelings of uselessness, unhappiness, and even depression. Moreover, the passive nature of a robot-dominated society may lead to a general lack of motivation and a reluctance to actively pursue one's goals, further exacerbating the negative psychological impacts.\n\nJust as the influx of slaves in ancient societies like Greece, Rome, and the Ottoman Empire led to the displacement of free workers and the suppression of wages, the rise of robots may exacerbate existing inequalities and create new forms of social and economic stratification. The wealthy elite who own and control these technologies may be able to further consolidate their power and influence, while the masses are left to struggle for scraps.\n\nIn this context, some individuals may seek to escape the economic insecurity and social dislocation of the robot age by actively selling themselves into a form of modern-day slavery. Just as in ancient Greece and Rome, where impoverished individuals would sometimes voluntarily enter into servitude as a means of securing a basic livelihood, the rise of robots may create a situation in which some people feel they have no other choice but to surrender their freedom and autonomy in exchange for a modicum of security and stability.\n\nIt is worth noting that slavery existed for centuries in ancient civilizations and was generally accepted as a normal part of social and economic life. The elites who benefited from the labor of slaves justified the practice through elaborate legal and philosophical frameworks, while the masses were often too preoccupied with their own survival to mount effective resistance.\n\nIn this sense, the robot age may represent a kind of neo-classical period, in which a small class of tech-savvy lords and ladies preside over a vast underclass of robots and under employed people. The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few may become even more extreme than it is today, leading to a society that is deeply stratified and fundamentally unequal.\n\nThe impact of robots on the domestic sphere is likely to be particularly significant. As robots become increasingly capable of handling a wide range of household tasks, from cooking and cleaning to childcare and home maintenance, traditional gender roles and family dynamics may shift dramatically. Robots will be able to work 24 hours a day (except for recharging times) and 365 days a year. Once the core household chores are done they may help out with DIY activities or engage in making household items such as furniture and bespoke clothing.\n\nThe availability of robots for intimate tasks like childcare and eldercare could have profound effects on family life, raising questions about the nature of emotional bonds and the potential for robots to be used as tools of surveillance and control within the home. In the same way that the porn industry were pioneers of VHS tapes, DVDs, online streaming video and VR, we should fully expect robots to be capable of performing sexual activities. With partners that always love you, no matter how badly you have let yourself go, and will never say no due to headaches, this will also have an impact on intimate relationships. Total fertility rates, which are already below population replacement levels in all parts of the world, except Africa, will fall further. It is ironic to think that robots will help fill the expected labour shortage as our populations decline and will help cause an even faster population decline\n\nOf course, the rise of robots and AI could also have some positive impacts on society, particularly in terms of freeing up human time and energy for more creative and fulfilling pursuits. If machines are able to take over many of the repetitive and mundane tasks that currently occupy much of the workforce, humans may have more opportunities to engage in activities that are intrinsically rewarding and socially beneficial, such as art, music, scientific research, and community service.\n\nIn ancient Greece, for example, the widespread use of slave labor allowed a small class of free citizens to devote themselves to intellectual and artistic pursuits, leading to a flourishing of philosophy, literature, and scientific inquiry. Similarly, in the robot age, the liberation of humans from the drudgery of work could lead to a new golden age of creativity and discovery, helping to address some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today, from climate change and resource depletion to disease and poverty. This is a nice thought. But how likely is it?\n\nIn the face of widespread job displacement and social disruption caused by the rise of robots and AI, governments may need to consider implementing programs similar to the grain dole and public festivals of ancient Rome, which provided citizens with a basic standard of living and opportunities for social engagement.\n\nUnder the Roman grain dole system, which was introduced in the late 2nd century BCE, the state distributed free grain to citizens as a means of alleviating poverty and ensuring social stability. This program was later expanded to include other essentials and provided sustenance for a significant portion of the population. Additionally, the Roman state provided citizens with numerous public holidays and festivals each year, often tied to religious observances or military victories, as a way of building social cohesion and loyalty. During these events, the state provided free food and entertainment, including banquets, gladiatorial games, and theatrical performances.\n\nIn the context of the robot age, similar programs could take the form of a universal basic income, providing every citizen with a guaranteed minimum income regardless of employment status, as well as the creation of new public spaces and social infrastructure to foster meaningful activities and interactions. One way to think of a robot is to compare it to a modern smartphone. A smartphone is not just a phone. It has replaced a huge number of objects ranging from phones, CDs, books, televisions, maps, encyclopaedias, fax machines, photocopiers- the list goes on. A robot could displace a similar number of items that we currently need to buy fully created. With household robots able to garden, cook, clean, make furniture, pottery, bespoke clothing and house extensions, it could be that peoples' need to participate in the monetary economy is significantly lower than it is today. A modest universal basic income top up may be sufficient.\n\nUltimately, the impact of humanoid robots and AI on society will depend on the choices we make as a species in the coming years and decades. If we can harness these technologies to serve human flourishing and the greater good, we may usher in a brighter and more fulfilling future. However, if we allow these technologies to be used primarily for oppression, exploitation, and control, we risk creating a dystopian future that erodes the very essence of our humanity.\n\nPart 5: The Future of Work in Space\n\nAs we grapple with the profound challenges and opportunities posed by the rise of robotics and automation here on Earth, some visionaries are already looking to the stars for the next great frontier of human endeavor. The idea of space exploration and colonization has long captured the imagination of scientists, entrepreneurs, and policymakers alike, offering a tantalizing vision of a future in which humanity spreads beyond the confines of our planet and establishes a permanent presence in the cosmos.\n\nCentral to this vision is the idea of human-robot collaboration, in which advanced machines work alongside human astronauts and colonists to explore, settle, and develop new worlds. This collaboration is already taking shape in the form of robotic missions to Mars, the Moon, and beyond, with machines like NASA's Perseverance rover paving the way for eventual human exploration and settlement.\n\nHistory Future Now mentions this as the conventional science fiction view was that the negative aspects of robots on Earth described in Part 4 could be offset by the excitement of humans going into space and colonising other planets, moons and asteroids.\n\nHowever, as we look to the future of work in space, it is becoming increasingly clear that robots and artificial intelligence will play an even more central role than previously imagined. With their ability to operate in harsh and dangerous environments, to perform complex tasks with precision and efficiency, and to work tirelessly without the need for life support systems, food, water, or rest, robots are better suited to the challenges of extraterrestrial labor than humans.\n\nIndeed, the colonization of space will be largely driven by robots and AI, with machines taking on the bulk of the work required to establish and maintain human settlements on other worlds. This could include everything from the construction of habitats and infrastructure to the extraction of resources and the cultivation of crops, as well as the exploration and scientific study of alien environments.\n\nSo while humans may eventually end up in space, the bulk of the work will be better suited to robots. Space is likely not to be man's final frontier but rather the dawn of planet-fulls of robots.\n\nConclusion - Navigating the Uncharted Territory of Robotics and Society\n\nThroughout this article, History Future Now has explored the complex web of issues surrounding the rise of robotics and AI, drawing on insights from history, economics, and social science to shed light on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. We have seen how the development of humanoid robots in particular echoes the historical institution of slavery, with machines designed to serve the interests of their owners and creators, often at the expense of human workers and communities.\n\nWe have examined the parallels between the institution of slavery in ancient civilizations and the modern phenomenon of mass migration, highlighting the ways in which the desire for cheap and exploitable labor has shaped human societies throughout history. And we have considered how the rise of robotics and AI could exacerbate these trends, leading to widespread job displacement, increased inequality, and social unrest.\n\nAt the same time, we have also explored the potential benefits of human-machine collaboration, particularly in the context of space exploration and colonization. We have seen how robots and AI systems could help to unlock new frontiers of discovery and achievement, enabling humanity to spread beyond the confines of our planet and establish a permanent presence in the cosmos.\n\nHowever, even as we glimpse the vast possibilities of this new era, we must also grapple with the profound ethical and social implications of these technologies.\n\nThe rise of robotics and AI raises fundamental questions about the nature of work, the distribution of wealth and power, and the very meaning of human existence itself. These are big questions. And nobody is being consulted as to whether we want these changes. They are simply going to happen, like it or not.\n\nAppendix\n\nYou will find below some videos of the robots discussed in Part 1. It is likely that these links will be broken as time passes by, but they are accurate at the time of writing in April 2024. The purpose of these videos is to highlight to the average reader the remarkable advances made in robots over the last 24 months. The issues raised in this article will be faced sooner that we may want or realise.\n\nGeneral video showing most of the companies listed in Part 1. Watch this first as it gives the best overview as of 23 March 2024.\n\nBoston Dynamics, is the grand-daddy in the field of robotics and continues to push the envelope with its Atlas humanoid robot. Although Atlas may not fall under the $50,000 price point in the near future, its advanced agility, strength, and dexterity make it a benchmark for humanoid robot capabilities. From parkour skills and backflips to navigating complex terrain and performing delicate tasks, Atlas showcases the cutting edge of humanoid robotics and serves as an inspiration for future advancements in the field. Boston Dynamics has been on this path for a long time and it is ahead of most. But new companies have emerged since 2022 that have made impressive progress and may end up eclipsing Boston Dynamics.\n\nLatest version of Atlas\n\nBoston Dynamics showing impressive mobility\n\nBoston Dynamics with better hands\n\nThe dog version and how they are training it\n\nAnd also the dog in real world applications\n\nTesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, is another notable contender in the field. Optimus is designed to perform a wide range of tasks in factories and homes. Tesla is relatively new to the field but has made huge advances in less than a year. By leveraging Tesla's expertise in AI and electric motors, Optimus aims to achieve smooth and efficient movement at a target price point below $20,000, making it a strong candidate for widespread adoption. They have only been doing robots since 2022 but what they have done is impressive.

We will also examine the potential divergence between technological development on Earth and in space, with space-based communities serving as testbeds for more advanced and less restricted applications.\n\nThroughout this piece, we will draw upon the lessons learned from previous technological revolutions to inform our understanding of the present and guide us through the uncharted territories of a world where platform technologies converge to reshape the human experience.\n\nFinally, there is also a very practical angle to this article. Imagine if you had known in advance the industries that would transform our society and our economy. This article will show you which are the future platform technologies to pay attention to.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nPart 1. Platform Technologies: Transformative Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nPlatform technologies are the foundational building blocks that underpin the development of a vast array of new products, services, and industries. These versatile and adaptable technologies have the potential to reshape entire sectors of society, driving disruptive innovations that fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.\n\nThroughout history, platform technologies have emerged as catalysts for profound societal transformation. Five relatively recent examples that have left an indelible mark on the fabric of modern society are electricity, the automobile, the telephone, the computer, and the birth control pill.\n\nElectricity, harnessed and distributed on a wide scale in the late 19th century, has been a fundamental enabler of the modern world, powering homes, factories, and cities, and serving as the foundation for countless other technologies. The automobile, invented in the late 19th century, has transformed transportation, commerce, and urban planning, providing people with unparalleled personal mobility and enabling the growth of cities and suburbs. The telephone, another transformative platform technology of the late 19th century, has revolutionized long-distance communication, creating new industries and shaping social norms. The computer, which first emerged in the mid-20th century, has revolutionized the way we process, store, and communicate information, transforming virtually every industry and enabling the development of groundbreaking technologies such as the internet.\n\nThe birth control pill, introduced in the 1960s, highlights a key point that some technologies can be simple yet have an enormous impact. It has empowered women to take control of their reproductive health, contributing to a dramatic shift in social norms, gender roles, and women's participation in the workforce.\n\nWhat sets platform technologies apart is their ability to serve as the foundation upon which other innovations can be built. They are not standalone innovations but rather enablers of a wide range of new possibilities. Moreover, platform technologies often converge and build upon one another, amplifying their transformative potential.\n\nAs we look to the future, a new wave of platform technologies is emerging, each with the potential to drive profound societal transformation on a scale that rivals or even surpasses that of their predecessors. These include artificial intelligence, space exploration, robotics, vertical farming, quantum computing, brain-computer interfaces, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and genomics. Like the platform technologies of the past, these emerging technologies are part of a complex and interconnected ecosystem, building upon and reinforcing each other to create new possibilities and disrupt existing industries.\n\nPart 2. Future Platform Technologies\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force that has the potential to reshape the very fabric of our society and redefine the boundaries of human capability. AI involves the development of intelligent machines and software capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.\n\nAI is arguably the core platform technology that will underpin all the others, with its usefulness being on par with electricity and computing. It is a critical enabler of many other emerging technologies, such as advanced robotics, space exploration, and brain-computer interfaces. In the field of humanoid robots, AI will play a crucial role in enabling these machines to perceive, learn, and interact with their environment in increasingly sophisticated ways, transforming the future of work and society.\n\nThe potential impact of AI is vast and far-reaching, with implications that could transform virtually every industry and sector. In healthcare, AI could revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat diseases, enabling earlier and more accurate detection, personalized treatment plans, and improved patient outcomes. In education, AI could unlock new frontiers in personalized learning, adaptive assessments, and intelligent tutoring systems. In transportation, AI will pave the way for autonomous vehicles, intelligent traffic management systems, and optimized logistics networks. In manufacturing, AI will drive unprecedented gains in quality control, predictive maintenance, and supply chain optimization.\n\nUnexpectedly, AI has also shown remarkable success in creative areas once thought to be the sole domain of humans. AI-generated films, TV shows, advertising, art, music, and novels are becoming increasingly sophisticated and indistinguishable from human-created content. While this development opens up exciting possibilities for increased human creativity, it also poses a threat to jobs in these fields. As AI-generated content floods the market, human creators may struggle to have their voices heard and maintain their livelihoods.\n\nHowever, the rise of AI also raises profound ethical and existential questions that we must grapple with as a society. Some AI researchers and philosophers have expressed grave concerns about the potential for advanced AI systems to pose an existential threat to humanity, particularly if they become sophisticated enough to bypass human control and pursue goals misaligned with human values.\n\nAddressing these challenges will require proactive efforts to ensure that the development and deployment of AI systems are guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. Despite these challenges and risks, the potential benefits of AI are immense, and the technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI, it is essential that we do so with a deep sense of responsibility and a commitment to ensuring that the technology is developed and used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole.\n\nAs humanity stands at the threshold of a new era in space technologies and exploration, we are witnessing a transformative shift driven by the groundbreaking innovations of companies like SpaceX. By dramatically reducing the cost of accessing space through reusable rockets such as the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX has opened up a world of possibilities for scientific discovery, economic growth, and human expansion beyond Earth.\n\nThe impact of SpaceX's achievements cannot be overstated. With the successful development and deployment of reusable rocket technology, the company has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for space exploration and commercialisation. Experts anticipate that once Starship begins commercial operations, the cost of sending cargo to orbit could drop to levels comparable to airfreight rates for shipping goods from Shanghai to London. This dramatic reduction in space access costs has the potential to unlock a vast array of new industries and opportunities that were previously unimaginable.\n\nOne of the most exciting developments enabled by reduced space access costs is the growth of space tourism. As the cost of launching people into space decreases, companies like SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin are poised to offer suborbital and orbital flights to paying customers, allowing them to experience the thrill of spaceflight and witness the beauty of Earth from above. This new industry has the potential to inspire a new generation of space enthusiasts and drive further innovation in space technologies.\n\nIn addition to tourism, low Earth orbit is also becoming a critical gateway for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. With the ability to access space more affordably and frequently, space agencies and private companies can now establish a sustained presence in low Earth orbit, using it as a staging ground for deep space exploration. This could involve the construction of orbiting space stations, fuel depots, and other infrastructure that would support long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, paving the way for permanent human settlement beyond Earth.\n\nAnother promising prospect is the emergence of asteroid mining. With the ability to access space at greatly reduced costs, companies could begin to prospect and extract valuable resources from asteroids, such as rare earth metals, water, and other minerals. These resources could be used to support in-space manufacturing and construction, as well as brought back to Earth to supplement dwindling supplies. Asteroid mining has the potential to revolutionise the global economy and provide a new source of wealth and resources for humanity.\n\nSpace is also becoming an attractive location for conducting work that is deemed too dangerous or controversial to be carried out on Earth, such as genetic engineering. The unique environment of space, with its reduced gravity, increased radiation exposure, and isolation from Earth's biosphere, could provide an ideal setting for researchers to push the boundaries of science and technology without the same level of risk or regulatory oversight. This could lead to groundbreaking advancements in fields such as biotechnology, medicine, and materials science.\n\nThe transformative impact of reduced space access costs extends beyond just economic opportunities. By lowering the barriers to space exploration, we can expand the frontiers of human knowledge and understanding, deepening our insights into the origins and evolution of the universe, the search for extraterrestrial life, and the potential for human settlement beyond Earth.\n\nThis new era of space technologies and exploration represents a watershed moment in human history. By opening up new frontiers for exploration, discovery, and economic growth, this breakthrough has the potential to reshape our world and our future in ways we are only beginning to imagine. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in space, it is crucial that we do so with a sense of responsibility, international cooperation, and a commitment to using these technologies for the benefit of all humanity.\n\nHumanoid robots have the potential to revolutionise not only the way we work but also the way we live. By combining advanced artificial intelligence, sophisticated sensors, and highly dexterous mechanical systems, these robots are poised to serve as a foundation for a wide range of applications and innovations that will extend far beyond the traditional confines of industrial settings.\n\nThe development of humanoid robots builds upon and integrates several other key platform technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced materials, and high-performance computing. AI algorithms enable humanoid robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and learn from their experiences, while advanced materials and manufacturing techniques allow for the creation of lightweight, strong, and flexible components that mimic human physiology.\n\nThe integration of these platform technologies in humanoid robots opens up a vast array of potential applications that will transform industries and our daily lives. In manufacturing and logistics, humanoid robots like Figure.ai's Figure 01 and Tesla's Optimus could work alongside human employees, taking on repetitive or dangerous tasks and adapting to changing workflows.\n\nIn our homes, humanoid robots could become ubiquitous helpers, taking on tasks such as home maintenance, furniture assembly, cooking, and cleaning. They could also provide companionship and emotional support, engaging in conversation, providing entertainment, and offering basic medical advice and assistance.\n\nThe potential applications of humanoid robots in healthcare are particularly promising. They could assist with personalised care and support in hospitals and clinics, as well as home-based care, helping patients with mobility issues or chronic conditions to maintain their independence.\n\nAs humanoid robots become more advanced and integrated into our daily lives, they will also raise important ethical and societal questions. The widespread adoption of these robots could have significant implications for employment, privacy, and security. There are also concerns about the impact of humanoid robots on human social interactions and the potential for them to be used for intimate companionship, raising complex moral and philosophical questions.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of humanoid robots are immense, and their development as a platform technology is likely to accelerate in the coming years. As they become more affordable, reliable, and capable, these robots will increasingly become a part of our daily lives, transforming the way we work, live, and interact with the world around us.\n\nAs the world's population continues to grow, with projections indicating a global population of nearly 10 billion by 2050, the demand for food is set to increase dramatically. Compounding this challenge is the rapid expansion of the middle class, particularly in developing countries, which is associated with higher consumption of resource-intensive foods such as meat and dairy products. Simultaneously, the availability of arable land and freshwater resources is declining due to urbanisation, land degradation, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Climate change further exacerbates this problem, as rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events disrupt traditional agricultural systems and reduce crop yields. The combined effects of population growth, changing consumption patterns, resource scarcity, and climate change create a perfect storm that threatens to undermine global food security and sustainability.\n\nVertical farming, an innovative agricultural method that involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers within a controlled indoor environment, offers a promising solution to help address these challenges. This platform technology can be used to grow a wide variety of crops, ranging from salad greens and herbs to fruits like strawberries and even staple crops such as rice, wheat, and protein-rich plants like soy and peas. By growing crops indoors in a controlled environment, vertical farms can achieve higher yields with significantly less land, water, and fertiliser compared to conventional farms. For example, UK based vertical farming company, Fischer Farms, has shown that it can grow wheat using 25 times less land and salads using 250 times less land than comparable outdoor grown crops. They also consume about 5% of the water and 7.5 times less fertiliser than traditional farms.\n\nVertical farming has the potential to revolutionise agriculture and address many of the challenges associated with traditional farming methods. It can be compared to previous transformative agricultural technologies such as mechanisation, irrigation, and the Green Revolution, which greatly increased agricultural productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. Like these previous technologies, vertical farming has the potential to transform agriculture by increasing productivity, efficiency, and sustainability.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, the widespread adoption of vertical farming faces several challenges, including high initial capital costs, energy requirements for lighting and climate control, and the need for specialized skills and knowledge to operate and maintain the systems.\n\nHowever, several factors are driving down the costs of vertical farming, making it increasingly competitive with traditional agriculture. Advances in LED lighting efficiency, declining renewable energy costs, and automation are streamlining the labor-intensive tasks involved in indoor farming, reducing costs and improving efficiency. As these trends continue, it is likely that vertical farming will become economically viable for a wider range of crops, including staples such as rice, wheat, peas, and soy.\n\nVertical farming represents a promising platform technology that can help address the growing challenges of food security and sustainability in an increasingly populated, urbanised, and resource-constrained world. By enabling efficient, local production of a wide range of crops, vertical farming can help fill the gap between food demand and supply, while also reducing the environmental impact of agriculture and improving access to fresh, healthy food. As the technology continues to advance and become more cost-effective, vertical farming has the potential to play a crucial role in feeding the world's population in the face of climate change and resource scarcity.\n\nQuantum computing is emerging as a revolutionary technology that promises to transform the way we solve complex problems and drive innovation across multiple industries. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum computers have the potential to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, opening up new possibilities for breakthroughs in fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, materials science, and optimisation.\n\nAt its core, quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computing. While classical computers use bits that can only be in one of two states (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a property known as superposition. This unique capability allows quantum computers to perform complex computations that are currently intractable for classical computers.\n\nThe potential impact of quantum computing is vast and far-reaching. In cryptography, quantum computers could break current encryption methods but also help develop new, more secure ones. In drug discovery, quantum computing could accelerate the development of new medicines by simulating complex molecular systems. Quantum optimisation algorithms could help solve complex problems in logistics, finance, and energy distribution, while quantum machine learning could lead to more powerful AI systems.\n\nQuantum computing can be considered a platform technology, as it could enable a wide range of applications across multiple industries, similar to how the transistor and the internet served as platforms for countless innovations and new markets.\n\nThe development of quantum computing can be compared to previous transformative technologies that have reshaped computing and society, such as the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and the introduction of integrated circuits, which revolutionised computing and laid the foundation for modern computers and electronic devices.\n\nDespite the immense potential of quantum computing, its development faces numerous technical and engineering challenges, including maintaining the delicate quantum states of qubits and developing new algorithms and software for quantum computers. However, governments, academic institutions, and major technology companies are heavily investing in quantum computing research and development, working to overcome these challenges.\n\nAs with any transformative technology, the development and deployment of quantum computing also raise important ethical and societal questions, such as the impact on privacy, security, and the distribution of benefits and risks, which must be carefully considered and proactively managed.\n\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are emerging as a transformative technology that has the potential to revolutionise the way we communicate, learn, and work. By enabling direct communication between the brain and external devices, BCIs represent a new frontier in technology that could unlock unprecedented possibilities for human augmentation and empowerment.\n\nAt their core, BCIs work by measuring brain activity, typically using electrodes placed on the scalp or implanted directly into the brain, and translating that activity into commands or actions that can be executed by a computer or other device. This direct connection between the brain and external systems opens up a world of possibilities for new forms of communication, control, and augmentation.\n\nThe potential impact of BCIs is vast and far-reaching. In the medical field, BCIs could provide a lifeline for people with severe motor disabilities, enabling them to regain the ability to communicate and control their environment. BCIs could also pave the way for new assistive technologies, such as robotic prosthetics controlled directly by the user's thoughts.\n\nBeyond medical applications, BCIs have the potential to transform the way we interact with technology in our daily lives. They could usher in a new era of hands-free control, making technology more intuitive and accessible.

The integration of vertical farming with other advanced technologies, such as AI, robotics, and biotechnology, will enable the creation of highly efficient, self-sustaining ecosystems that support human life in the harsh conditions of space.\n\nThe contrast between the rapid technological advancements in space and the more regulated and restricted development on Earth will become starker. Space-based communities may serve as laboratories for experimenting with novel forms of social organisation, governance, and economic systems, leveraging the unique opportunities and challenges presented by the space environment and the advanced capabilities of platform technologies.\n\nAs space colonies grow in size, complexity, and self-sufficiency, the question of their political status and relationship with Earth will become increasingly pressing. Some colonies may seek greater autonomy and even full independence, while others may opt for a more federated structure that balances local decision-making with the benefits of maintaining close ties to Earth. The negotiation of these relationships will likely involve a complex interplay of economic, political, and cultural factors, as Earth-based governments and space colonies navigate the challenges of an expanding human civilisation.\n\nOn Earth, demographic challenges will reach a critical point, with many countries experiencing significant population declines due to persistently low fertility rates. This demographic shift will have profound implications for economic growth, social stability, and the viability of smaller communities. Advanced robotics and AI may play a crucial role in mitigating some of the economic impacts of population decline, by automating various tasks and services and supporting the maintenance of infrastructure in depopulated areas. The combination of population decline and technological advancements may lead to the abandonment of smaller villages and towns, as people concentrate in larger urban centres or migrate to space-based settlements.\n\nGeopolitically, nations will intensify their competition and potentially engage in conflicts as they seek to assert control over critical space-based resources and advanced technologies. The shifting global power dynamics will see countries that have successfully navigated the challenges of technological disruption and demographic change emerge as dominant players, while those that have struggled to adapt face increasing instability and decline. The establishment of international frameworks for cooperation and conflict resolution in space will become increasingly critical to maintaining peace and stability in an era of rapid cosmic expansion.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe next 100 years will bring about transformative changes in every aspect of our lives. From the economy and society to geopolitics and the environment, the interplay of these technologies will present both immense opportunities and daunting challenges. Some History Future Now readers will be excited by this future. Others will recoil in horror. Either way, many of these changes are inevitable.\n\nVertical farming, in particular, will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of agriculture, land use, and space exploration. As this technology evolves from its early focus on salads, herbs, and fruiting plants to the large-scale cultivation of staple crops, it will revolutionise the way we produce food, reduce the environmental impact of agriculture, and enable the establishment of human settlements beyond Earth.\n\nThe divergence between technological development on Earth and in space will be a defining feature of the coming century, with space-based communities serving as testbeds for more advanced and less restricted applications of platform technologies. This divergence may lead to new forms of social, economic, and political organisation, as well as debates over the governance and ethics of these technologies.\n\nOn Earth, demographic shifts, particularly population decline in most countries, will present significant challenges and opportunities. Advanced technologies, such as AI and robotics, may help mitigate some of the economic impacts of these shifts, while also contributing to changes in land use and settlement patterns.\n\nAs space colonies mature and their aspirations for greater autonomy and self-determination grow, the relationship between these settlements and Earth-based governments will become increasingly complex. Navigating this new landscape will require a delicate balance of cooperation and compromise, as all parties work to establish a stable and mutually beneficial framework for an expanding human presence in the cosmos.\n\nTo successfully navigate this uncharted territory, we must adopt proactive and collaborative approaches to technology governance and innovation, bringing together diverse stakeholders to anticipate and address the complex issues that arise. Fostering public understanding, trust, and engagement with converging technologies will be essential to building broad-based support for responsible innovation, while directing the development and deployment of technologies towards the greater good will help ensure that the benefits are widely shared. But while these are things that we must do, it is unlikely that we will get agreement to do so on a planetary basis. The Covid 19 pandemic showed how governments could impose their will on billions of people, but also showed that the next time this is attempted there will be greater resistance and less consensus.\n\nUltimately, the success of nations and societies in navigating the challenges of the next 100 years will depend on their ability to adapt to change, invest in human capital and social cohesion, and harness the power of innovation and collaboration to build a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future for all, both on Earth and beyond.\n\nIn the meantime, you should start researching which companies are doing pioneering work in these platform technologies so you can invest in them. After all, whether you like it or not, this future is going to happen and so you will be far better off being one of the haves, rather than one of the have nots",

To unravel these questions, we must explore the forces driving each phenomenon and consider their implications for the future of labor, inequality, and social cohesion in the age of intelligent machines. This is a prefect subject for History Future Now! Let's get started.\n\nPart 1: The Case for Mass Migration\n\nAcross the developed world, populations are aging rapidly as birth rates plummet and life expectancies rise. In Japan, Italy, and Germany, over 20% of the population is already over 65, while the U.S., U.K., and Canada are close behind. This demographic shift presents significant challenges for economic growth, public finances, and social stability.\n\nAs the elderly share of the population grows, the working-age cohort shrinks, leading to labor shortages and declining productivity. At the same time, the costs of supporting retirees through pensions, healthcare, and social services rise, straining government budgets and intergenerational solidarity. Without a significant increase in migration, experts argue, aging societies face a bleak future of economic stagnation and social upheaval.\n\nEven today, many advanced economies face acute labor shortages in critical sectors like healthcare, technology, agriculture, and manufacturing. In the U.S., for example, there are over 1 million unfilled jobs in healthcare alone, while farmers from California to Washington state report billions in lost crops due to a lack of workers.\n\nMigrants, who tend to be younger and more mobile than native-born workers, play a vital role in filling these gaps. In the U.K., migrants comprise over a quarter of doctors and 17% of nurses. In Canada, immigrants account for nearly half of science and engineering doctoral graduates.\n\nWithout the skills and dynamism that migrants bring, many industries would struggle to find the workers they need to grow and innovate.\n\nBeyond filling immediate labor gaps, migration can provide a powerful boost to long-term economic growth and living standards. A number of studies have shown that immigration increases productivity, entrepreneurship, and innovation in host countries.\n\nMany migrants tend to be highly motivated and aspirational, with a strong drive to succeed in their new homes, especially in places like the US. In the U.S., immigrants are twice as likely as native-born citizens to start businesses, and nearly half of America's \"unicorn\" startups (valued at over $1 billion) have at least one immigrant founder.\n\nAt a macroeconomic level, migration increases aggregate demand and expands the tax base, supporting consumption and public finances. A 2018 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that immigration had a net positive fiscal impact in the U.S., with immigrants contributing $63 billion more in taxes than they received in public benefits over the past decade.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this is not the case for immigration to the European Union, with its more generous welfare levels. According to a 2023 report by the University of Amsterdam, immigrants from developed Western countries make substantial positive fiscal contributions to the Netherlands over their lifetimes. Those from North America contribute around EUR 200,000 per person, while immigrants from the UK, Ireland, Scandinavia, and Japan each contribute between EUR 194,000 to EUR 208,000 per person.\n\nIn contrast, immigrants from developing non-Western countries impose significant fiscal costs. Those from the Horn of Africa and Sudan have a negative net impact of -EUR 606,000 per person, while immigrants from Morocco (-EUR 542,000), Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and Iraq (-EUR 418,000), and Turkey (-EUR 340,000) also generate large costs. Other Western European countries are likely to have similar results as they also have similar worker protections and high welfare standards.\n\nAs the ratio of retirees to workers rises, many countries face a looming crisis in their pension and social security systems. Without a significant increase in working-age adults, there will simply not be enough taxpayers to support the growing ranks of pensioners.\n\nMigration offers a potential solution to this demographic imbalance. By bringing in young, productive workers who pay taxes and contribute to social insurance systems, countries can shore up the long-term sustainability of their retirement programs. In the U.S., for example, immigrants contribute over $300 billion per year to the Social Security trust fund.\n\nMoreover, migrants themselves tend to have higher fertility rates than native-born citizens, helping to slow population aging and maintain a more favorable worker-to-pensioner ratio over time. In this way, migration can act as a demographic \"safety valve,\" mitigating the fiscal pressures of aging societies.\n\nAs life expectancy rises and the number of elderly people grows, the demand for healthcare and eldercare services is increasing rapidly. The U.S. alone will need an additional 1.1 million home health aides and personal care assistants by 2030 to keep up with the needs of its aging population.\n\nMigrants already play a critical role in providing care for the elderly in many advanced economies. In the U.S., nearly a quarter of health care workers are foreign-born, while in the U.K., migrants make up 17% of the adult social care workforce. These migrant care workers perform demanding and often low-paid work that is essential to the health and dignity of aging societies.\n\nWithout a steady supply of migrant labor, many countries would face a severe shortage of caregivers, leading to poorer health outcomes, greater strains on families, and a reduced quality of life for the elderly. As longevity increases and the ranks of the very old swell, the need for migrant care workers will only grow more acute.\n\nIn summary, the economic case for immigration in the context of aging populations and labor shortages is strong, particularly in countries with flexible labor markets and modest welfare states like the United States. However, in Europe, with its more extensive worker protections and generous social benefits, the fiscal impact of immigration varies significantly depending on the origin and skill level of the migrants. While highly-skilled immigrants from developed countries tend to make substantial positive contributions, those from developing regions often impose net costs on European welfare systems over their lifetimes.\n\nYet even as the case for migration grows stronger in some contexts, the rise of automation and artificial intelligence raises profound questions about the future of work and the ongoing demand for human labor. If machines can perform an ever-expanding range of tasks more efficiently and cheaply than humans, will migrants still be needed to fill gaps in the labor market? Or will they, too, find themselves displaced by the inexorable march of technological progress?\n\nPart 2: Robots and the Future of Work\n\nThe history of capitalism is in many ways the history of automation - of machines and technology steadily replacing human labor in a widening range of tasks and occupations. From the spinning jenny and the power loom of the Industrial Revolution to the assembly lines and computerization of the 20th century, automation has been a persistent driver of productivity growth and job displacement.\n\nYet recent years have seen a marked acceleration in the pace and scope of automation, driven by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning. Today's robots and AI systems are not the clunky, limited machines of the past, but increasingly flexible, intelligent, and capable of taking on complex cognitive and physical tasks.\n\nThis new wave of automation is already transforming industries from manufacturing and logistics to finance and customer service. In factories around the world, robots are assembling cars, electronics, and appliances with speed and precision that far exceeds human workers. In warehouses and distribution centers, autonomous drones and conveyor systems are revolutionizing supply chains and reducing the need for human pickers and packers.\n\nEven in traditionally \"white-collar\" domains like law, journalism, and medicine, AI systems are beginning to encroach on tasks that were once the exclusive preserve of human professionals. Machine learning algorithms can now review legal contracts, write news articles, and diagnose diseases with accuracy that rivals or exceeds human experts.\n\nThe potential for job displacement in these fields is significant. For example, a 2019 study by the Brookings Institution estimated that up to 25% of jobs in the U.S. legal industry could be automated in the coming years, while a 2020 report by the World Economic Forum suggested that AI could replace up to 85 million jobs globally by 2025.\n\nAs the capabilities of AI and robotics continue to grow, the potential for automation to displace human labor across the economy is becoming increasingly apparent.\n\nPerhaps the most striking development in recent years has been the emergence of general purpose humanoid robots - machines designed to closely resemble and interact with humans, with the flexibility to perform a wide variety of tasks in different environments.\n\nCompanies like Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and Agility Robotics are at the forefront of this trend, developing robots that can walk, run, climb stairs, manipulate objects, and even perform delicate tasks like sewing and cooking. These robots are not the single-purpose machines of the past, but versatile platforms that can be programmed to take on a range of roles in factories, homes, and public spaces.\n\nTesla's Optimus robot, for example, is envisioned as a general-purpose humanoid assistant that can perform tasks like cooking, cleaning, and even providing elder care. With a target price point below $20,000, Optimus could soon be within reach of many households, potentially transforming the economics of domestic labor.\n\nOther companies like Figure.ai and Sanctuary AI are developing humanoid robots for applications ranging from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and customer service. These robots leverage advanced control systems, sensors, and natural language processing to navigate complex environments and interact seamlessly with humans.\n\nThe implications of this new generation of humanoid robots are profound. As they become more affordable and capable, they could potentially automate a vast range of jobs that have long been considered safe from machines - from childcare and cooking to driving and manual labor.\n\nOne of the most immediate impacts of automation is likely to be the displacement of low-skill, routine jobs - the very occupations that have been the mainstay of migrant labor in recent decades.In sectors like agriculture, construction, and manufacturing, robots are already beginning to take on tasks that were once performed by human workers. Fruit-picking robots, brick-laying robots, and sewing robots are just a few examples of machines that are replacing low-wage migrant labor in these industries.\n\nAs these technologies become more advanced and affordable, the potential for displacement is vast. A recent study by the World Bank estimated that up to 800 million jobs worldwide could be automated by 2030, with low-skill workers in developing countries being the hardest hit.\n\nFor migrant workers who have long relied on these jobs as a path to economic mobility, the rise of automation presents a daunting challenge. As machines become cheaper and more capable than human labor, the demand for low-skill migrant workers may decline sharply, leaving them with few options for employment.\n\nBut it's not just low-skill jobs that are at risk of automation. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, even high-skill cognitive tasks are increasingly within reach of machines. AI systems can process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make decisions with speed and accuracy that surpasses human capabilities. This enables them to take on complex tasks like financial analysis, legal research, and medical diagnosis that were once the exclusive domain of highly-trained professionals.\n\nIn fields like finance, law, and medicine, AI systems are beginning to outperform human professionals in tasks like fraud detection, contract review, and disease diagnosis.\n\nAs these technologies continue to improve, they could potentially automate a wide range of knowledge work jobs - from accountants and financial analysts to lawyers and radiologists. For high-skill migrants who have long been sought after for their expertise and training, this trend presents a new and uncertain future.\n\nPerhaps most disruptive of all is the emerging model of \"robot-as-a-service\" - where businesses can rent or lease robots on an as-needed basis, without having to invest in expensive hardware or maintenance.\n\nCompanies like Amazon, Google, and Toyota are already experimenting with this model, offering cloud-based AI and robotics services that can be accessed by businesses of all sizes. This could potentially lower the barriers to automation for many companies, allowing them to quickly deploy robots and AI systems to perform a wide range of tasks.\n\nUnder this model, businesses would no longer need to hire large numbers of workers - either native-born or migrant - to perform routine tasks. Instead, they could simply rent robots or AI services as needed, scaling up or down depending on demand. This could lead to a profound shift in the nature of work, with fewer permanent jobs and more temporary, project-based contracts.\n\nThe rise of robot-as-a-service could also accelerate the pace of automation across the economy, as businesses face increasing pressure to adopt these technologies to remain competitive. As robots become cheaper, more flexible, and more widely available, the potential for job displacement across all skill levels may be greater than ever before.\n\nThe automation of both low-skill and high-skill tasks, coupled with the rise of robot-as-a-service models, poses a significant challenge to the future of work. As machines become more capable and cost-effective, the demand for human labor across the skill spectrum may decline, leaving both migrant and native-born workers vulnerable to displacement.\n\nPart 3 - Conclusion: The Paradox of Migration and Automation\n\nThe demographic realities of the 21st century are stark and unavoidable. With populations aging rapidly and birth rates plummeting, many advanced economies could face a future of stagnation and decline without a significant influx of young, productive migrants. There is an economic case for mass migration. The US with its more flexible labour market and lower levels of welfare mangers immigrants reasonably well. In Europe, with its greater labour protections and high welfare standards, the economic case for migration is positive for those coming from other developed countries but generally negative from those from developing countries.\n\nYet at the very same time, the accelerating pace of automation and the rise of increasingly capable robots and AI systems are casting doubt on the long-term demand for human labor itself. As machines become more flexible, intelligent, and affordable, they are beginning to encroach on a wider range of tasks and occupations - from low-skill jobs in agriculture and manufacturing to high-skill cognitive work in fields like finance and medicine.\n\nThe emergence of general purpose humanoid robots, designed to work alongside humans in a variety of roles, represents a particularly disruptive development. As these machines become more advanced and widely available, they could potentially automate vast swaths of the service sector and even domestic labor - the very jobs that have long been the mainstay of migrant workers.\n\nHerein lies the paradox: if robots can perform the same tasks as human workers more efficiently and at lower cost, what is the economic rationale for mass migration? Why should countries open their borders to large numbers of foreign workers when machines can increasingly fill the same gaps in the labor market?\n\nThe irony is that the same demographic forces driving the need for migration - namely, aging populations and shrinking workforces - are also accelerating the push towards automation. As labor shortages intensify and wage pressures rise, businesses face increasing incentives to invest in labor-saving technologies like robots and AI. In this sense, migration and automation can be seen as two sides of the same coin - both driven by the inexorable march of demographic change.\n\nYet while migration offers a vital lifeline for aging societies in the short term, it is no panacea for the long-term challenges of automation. Even if countries were to open their borders and welcome millions of new workers, there is no guarantee that these migrants would be immune to the job-displacing effects of robots and AI. Indeed, as we have seen, many of the low-skill, routine jobs that have long been the mainstay of migrant labor are among the most vulnerable to automation in the coming years.\n\nUltimately, the paradox of migration and automation demands a fundamental rethinking of our economic and social models. If machines can increasingly perform the tasks that have long been the domain of human workers, then we must ask: what is the role of human labor in the economy of the future? What is the purpose of work itself, and how do we ensure that the benefits of automation are widely shared rather than concentrated in the hands of a few?\n\nHow we choose to respond to these challenges will determine not only the fate of migrant workers, but the very fabric of our social and economic lives in the century to come.\n\nThe Perils of Prediction: Lessons from History on Navigating an Uncertain Future",

Similarly, the rapid adoption of smartphones and social media platforms has transformed communication, commerce, and politics in ways few could have foreseen at the dawn of the digital age.\n\nYet, by examining the past through a multidisciplinary lens, we can uncover valuable insights into the art and science of predicting the future. From the ancient Delphic Oracle's cryptic prophecies to the sophisticated predictive models of modern data science, humans have employed a wide range of techniques to anticipate what lies ahead. While some predictions, such as Arthur C. Clarke's vision of geostationary satellites in 1945, have proven remarkably prescient, others, like the Y2K hysteria of the late 1990s, serve as cautionary tales about the limits of our foresight.\n\nIn this History Future Now article, we will explore the key factors that influence our ability to predict the future, drawing upon historical case studies and contemporary examples to illustrate the challenges and opportunities of anticipating change.\n\nWe will begin by examining the psychological barriers that hinder our ability to envision the future, from cognitive biases to the limitations of human imagination. Next, we will explore the societal factors that shape our collective expectations and assumptions, from cultural norms to the influence of media and technology. We will then delve into the technological dimensions of predicting the future, examining how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain are transforming our ability to anticipate and shape the future. Finally, we will consider strategies for navigating the unknown, from scenario planning and trend analysis to cultivating a mindset of adaptability and resilience.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nII. The Human Factor: Psychological Barriers to Predicting the Future\n\nOur ability to predict the future is profoundly shaped by the psychological factors that influence our perceptions, beliefs, and behaviours. In this section, we'll explore some of the key psychological barriers that hinder our ability to anticipate change and consider strategies for overcoming them.\n\nOne of the most pervasive psychological barriers to predicting the future is the \" knowledge illusion, \" a cognitive bias that leads us to overestimate our understanding of complex systems and phenomena. In a classic 2002 study by Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil, participants were asked to rate their understanding of various devices, such as zippers and toilets, before and after being asked to explain how they work in detail. The results showed that people consistently overestimated their knowledge, and that attempting to explain the devices' mechanisms revealed the gaps and limitations in their understanding.\n\nThis tendency to overestimate our knowledge can lead us to make confident predictions about the future based on incomplete or flawed mental models. For example, in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, many experts and policymakers failed to anticipate the systemic risks posed by the complex web of derivatives and subprime mortgages, in part because they overestimated their understanding of the financial system's intricacies.\n\nTo overcome the knowledge illusion, it's important to cultivate a mindset of intellectual humility, recognizing the limits of our understanding and seeking out diverse perspectives and expertise. Techniques like \"red teaming,\" in which a designated group is tasked with challenging assumptions and identifying blind spots, can also help us uncover gaps in our knowledge and improve our ability to anticipate potential pitfalls.\n\nAnother psychological barrier to predicting the future is the familiarity heuristic , a mental shortcut that leads us to rely on familiar patterns and experiences when making judgments about the unknown. This tendency can cause us to underestimate the likelihood of rare or unprecedented events, such as the September 11th terrorist attacks or the COVID-19 pandemic, which fall outside our usual frame of reference.\n\nThe familiarity heuristic can also lead us to assume that the future will resemble the past, even in the face of disruptive change. A striking analogy for this cognitive bias is the story of turkeys and their relationship with humans. For months, turkeys on a farm may grow accustomed to the daily routine of being fed and cared for by their human keepers. The consistency of this experience can lull the turkeys into a false sense of security, leading them to believe that this pattern will continue indefinitely. However, as the holiday season approaches, the turkeys are suddenly taken away for slaughter, their previous assumptions shattered by a stark and unexpected reality.\n\nSimilarly, in the early days of the internet, many established media companies failed to recognize the transformative potential of digital technology, assuming that online news and entertainment would remain a niche market. They had grown familiar with the traditional media landscape and struggled to envision a future that deviated from that well-known path. As a result, they were slow to adapt their business models and lost ground to nimble digital upstarts like Facebook and Netflix, who were not constrained by the same familiarity heuristic and were able to capitalize on the disruptive potential of the internet.\n\nTo overcome the familiarity heuristic, it's important to actively seek out diverse and unconventional perspectives, and to challenge our assumptions about what is possible or likely. Just as the turkeys' limited experience led them astray, our own reliance on familiar patterns can blind us to the possibility of radical change. Techniques like counterfactual thinking, which involves imagining alternative outcomes or scenarios, can help us break free from the constraints of past experience and envision a wider range of possible futures. By actively questioning our assumptions and considering novel possibilities, we can cultivate a more flexible and adaptive mindset, better equipped to anticipate and navigate the uncertain future ahead.\n\nA third psychological barrier to predicting the future is the optimism bias , a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes and underestimate the likelihood of negative ones. This bias can lead us to make overly rosy predictions about the future, whether in our personal lives or in the context of business and policy decisions.\n\nFor example, in the realm of project management, the optimism bias can lead planners to underestimate the time, cost, and risks associated with complex undertakings, a phenomenon known as the \"planning fallacy.\" A classic example is the Sydney Opera House, which was originally estimated to cost $7 million and take four years to build, but ultimately cost $102 million and took 14 years to complete.\n\nTo overcome the optimism bias, it's important to take a clear-eyed view of potential obstacles and challenges, and to build in buffers and contingencies to account for unexpected setbacks. Techniques like \"pre-mortem\" analysis, which involves imagining that a project or initiative has failed and working backwards to identify potential causes, can help us anticipate and mitigate risks.\n\nA final psychological barrier to predicting the future is the sunk cost fallacy , a tendency to continue investing in a losing proposition because of the resources we've already committed. This bias can lead us to cling to outdated technologies, strategies, or beliefs, even in the face of mounting evidence that they are no longer effective or relevant.\n\nFor example, in the 1980s and 1990s, many established companies in the music industry were slow to recognize the disruptive potential of digital downloading and file-sharing, in part because they had heavily invested in the production and distribution of physical media like CDs and cassettes. As a result, they were ill-prepared for the rapid shift to online music consumption, and struggled to adapt to the new digital landscape.\n\nTo overcome the sunk cost fallacy, it's important to regularly reassess our investments and strategies in light of new information and changing circumstances. This may require making difficult decisions to cut losses or pivot to new approaches, but it can ultimately help us stay agile and responsive in the face of disruptive change.\n\nIn the next section, we'll explore how societal factors, from cultural norms to media influences, shape our collective assumptions and expectations.\n\nIII. The Societal Sphere: Cultural Norms and Expectations\n\nOur ability to predict and navigate the future is heavily influenced by the broader societal context in which we live. Cultural norms, values, and expectations shape our collective vision of what's possible and likely to come. In this section, we'll explore how these societal factors can act as barriers to anticipating change and consider strategies for overcoming them.\n\nOne significant societal barrier to predicting the future is the inertia of tradition, the tendency for established norms and practices to persist even in the face of changing circumstances. This resistance to change can hinder our ability to anticipate and adapt to emerging trends and challenges.\n\nConsider the case of Kodak, a company that dominated the film photography industry for nearly a century. Despite inventing the first digital camera in 1975, Kodak was slow to embrace the technology, fearing it would cannibalize its lucrative film business. By clinging to tradition and underestimating the disruptive potential of digital photography, Kodak ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2012.\n\nTo overcome the inertia of tradition, organizations must cultivate a culture of innovation and adaptability. This requires leaders who are willing to question long-held assumptions, embrace experimentation, and take calculated risks. By fostering a mindset of continuous learning and improvement, organizations can stay agile and responsive in the face of change.\n\nAnother societal barrier to predicting the future is the echo chamber effect , the tendency for individuals to seek out and reinforce information that confirms their existing beliefs while avoiding contradictory perspectives. This can lead to conformity and groupthink, where dissenting views are suppressed, and critical thinking is discouraged.\n\nThe Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 illustrates the dangers of groupthink. President John F. Kennedy and his advisors, eager to topple Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, failed to adequately question the flawed assumptions and rosy predictions of the CIA's plan. As a result, the invasion was a disastrous failure, with far-reaching consequences for U.S. foreign policy.\n\nTo combat the echo chamber effect, it's crucial to actively seek out diverse perspectives and encourage dissenting opinions. Techniques like \"red teaming,\" where a group is tasked with challenging assumptions and identifying weaknesses in a plan, can help organizations make more robust decisions. By fostering a culture of intellectual humility and constructive debate, we can expand our collective blind spots and improve our ability to anticipate and navigate change.\n\nA third societal barrier to predicting the future is the limits of our collective imagination , the difficulty of envisioning radically different possibilities beyond our current frame of reference. These failures of foresight can cause us to overlook or dismiss emerging trends and ideas that challenge the status quo.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the British Admiralty dismissed the potential of submarines, believing they would never pose a significant threat to the Royal Navy's supremacy. This failure of imagination left Britain ill-prepared for the German U-boat campaigns of World War I, which nearly crippled the nation's maritime trade.\n\nTo expand our collective foresight, it's important to cultivate a \"futures mindset,\" one that actively explores and imagines alternative possibilities. Techniques like scenario planning, which involves envisioning multiple plausible futures and their implications, can help organizations challenge assumptions and prepare for a range of outcomes. By nurturing creativity, curiosity, and unconventional thinking, we can push the boundaries of what we believe is possible and anticipate emerging opportunities and threats.\n\nFinally, our ability to predict and shape the future is often complicated by the tension between competing values, priorities, and worldviews within society . These tensions can create conflict and gridlock, making it difficult to reach consensus or take decisive action on complex challenges.\n\nThe ongoing debate over climate change policy illustrates this tension. While there is broad scientific consensus on the need for urgent action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, progress has been hindered by competing economic, political, and ideological interests. Balancing these often-contradictory priorities requires difficult trade-offs and compromises.\n\nTo navigate these tensions, it's essential to foster a culture of dialogue, empathy, and collaboration. This involves actively seeking to understand different perspectives, finding common ground where possible, and making principled compromises when necessary. By engaging in good-faith efforts to bridge divides and align competing values, we can develop more holistic and sustainable approaches to the challenges we face.\n\nIn the next section, we'll explore how technological factors, from the pace of innovation to the disruptive potential of emerging technologies, are transforming our ability to anticipate and navigate the unknown.\n\nIV. The March of Progress: Technological Disruption and Adaptation\n\nThe rapid pace of technological change is one of the most significant factors shaping our ability to predict and navigate the future. From the invention of the printing press to the rise of the internet, new technologies have repeatedly disrupted existing industries, transformed social norms, and reshaped the course of history. In this section, we'll explore how technology is changing the landscape of prediction and adaptation, and consider strategies for staying ahead of the curve.\n\nOne of the key drivers of technological disruption is the exponential nature of technological progress , as encapsulated by Moore's Law. This principle, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles roughly every two years, leading to a rapid increase in computing power and a decrease in cost. This exponential growth has enabled breakthroughs in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to biotechnology, and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe impact of exponential technological change can be seen in the rapid evolution of the smartphone. In just over a decade, smartphones have gone from a niche product to a ubiquitous device that has transformed communication, commerce, and culture. The iPhone, first released in 2007, had a processor speed of 412 MHz and 128 MB of RAM. In contrast, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, released in 2023, is several hundred times faster, with a staggering increase in computing power that has enabled new capabilities like high-definition video streaming, augmented reality, and machine learning.\n\nTo stay ahead of the exponential curve, organizations must cultivate a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. This requires investing in research and development, experimenting with new technologies and business models, and being willing to disrupt one's own products and services before competitors do. By embracing the potential of exponential change, organizations can position themselves to thrive in an era of rapid technological transformation.\n\nAnother key aspect of technological disruption is the innovator's dilemma , a concept popularized by Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen. The innovator's dilemma refers to the challenge established companies face when confronted with disruptive technologies that initially appear less profitable or attractive than existing offerings. By dismissing these technologies as inferior or niche, incumbents often fail to anticipate their disruptive potential until it's too late.\n\nThe rise of Netflix and the fall of Blockbuster is a classic example of the innovator's dilemma in action. In the early 2000s, Blockbuster dominated the video rental market, with thousands of brick-and-mortar stores and a vast library of movies and TV shows. Meanwhile, Netflix was a small start-up that mailed DVDs to customers and had a limited selection. Blockbuster had the opportunity to acquire Netflix for $50 million in 2000, but passed on the offer, seeing it as a niche player with an inferior business model. Fast forward to 2020, and Netflix is a $220 billion company with over 200 million subscribers worldwide, while Blockbuster has been reduced to a single store in Bend, Oregon.\n\nTo overcome the innovator's dilemma, established companies must be willing to cannibalize their own offerings and invest in disruptive technologies, even when they appear less profitable in the short term. This requires a culture of experimentation, risk-taking, and long-term thinking, as well as a willingness to challenge the status quo and embrace new business models. By proactively disrupting themselves, companies can stay ahead of the curve and avoid being blindsided by upstart competitors.\n\nWhile technological change is often predictable in its general trajectory, it can also be punctuated by rare and unpredictable events that have outsized impacts on the course of history. These so-called \" black swan \" events, a term coined by philosopher Nassim Nicholas Taleb, are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and retrospective predictability.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of a black swan event that has had far-reaching consequences for technology, society, and the economy. Prior to the pandemic, remote work and online education were relatively niche practices, and e-commerce accounted for only a small fraction of retail sales. However, the sudden and severe disruption caused by the pandemic accelerated the adoption of these technologies and practices, compressing years of digital transformation into a matter of months. Companies that were already investing in digital infrastructure and capabilities, such as Zoom and Amazon, were well-positioned to capitalize on this sudden shift, while those that were slow to adapt struggled to keep up.\n\nTo build resilience against black swan events, organizations must cultivate a culture of preparedness, flexibility, and rapid adaptation. This requires scenario planning to anticipate and prepare for a range of possible futures, as well as the ability to quickly pivot strategies and resources in response to changing circumstances. By building in redundancy, diversity, and adaptability, organizations can reduce their vulnerability to unexpected shocks and position themselves to seize new opportunities as they arise.\n\nWhile technological change has the potential to create immense benefits for society, it can also have unintended negative consequences that are difficult to predict and mitigate. From the environmental impacts of industrialization to the social and political disruptions caused by automation and artificial intelligence, the history of technology is littered with examples of unintended consequences that have required ongoing adaptation and course correction.\n\nThe rise of social media is a recent example of a technology that has had both positive and negative unintended consequences. On the one hand, social media platforms have connected people across the globe, facilitated grassroots activism, and democratized access to information. On the other hand, they have also been implicated in the spread of mental health problems, the erosion of privacy, and the polarization of public discourse. As the full impacts of social media continue to unfold, society will need to grapple with these unintended consequences and develop new norms, regulations, and technologies to mitigate their negative effects.\n\nTo anticipate and mitigate the unintended consequences of technology, organizations must take a proactive and holistic approach to innovation. This requires considering not only the immediate benefits and use cases of a new technology, but also its potential long-term impacts on society, the environment, and human well-being.\n\nAs we've seen throughout this section, the march of technological progress is a double-edged sword, creating both immense opportunities and challenges for predicting and navigating the future. In the next and final section, we'll explore some specific strategies and frameworks for navigating the unknown and building resilience in the face of uncertainty.\n\nV. Strategies for Navigating the Unknown: Learning from the Past to Prepare for the Future\n\nAs we've explored throughout this article, predicting the future is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, one that requires grappling with a range of psychological, societal, and technological factors. While we may never achieve perfect foresight, there are strategies and frameworks we can learn from history to help us navigate the uncertainties of the future with greater skill and confidence.\n\nOne powerful tool for navigating uncertainty is scenario planning , a technique developed by military strategists and later adopted by businesses and governments. Scenario planning involves envisioning multiple plausible futures and developing contingency plans for each. By considering a range of possible outcomes, rather than betting on a single prediction, organizations can improve their resilience and adaptability in the face of change.\n\nShell, the global energy company, has been a pioneer of scenario planning since the 1970s. In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, Shell used scenario planning to anticipate the possibility of a future with higher energy prices and reduced demand. By preparing for this scenario, Shell was able to adapt more quickly than its competitors when the crisis hit, and emerged as a leader in the industry. More recently, Shell has used scenario planning to explore the potential impacts of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy, helping to guide its long-term strategy and investments.\n\nTo apply scenario planning in practice, organizations should start by identifying the key drivers of change and uncertainty in their environment, such as technological trends, demographic shifts, or geopolitical events. They should then develop a set of plausible scenarios that explore how these drivers could interact and evolve over time. For each scenario, organizations should identify the potential risks and opportunities, and develop contingency plans and strategic options. By regularly updating and refining these scenarios, organizations can improve their ability to anticipate and respond to changing circumstances.\n\nAnother useful framework for navigating the future is backcasting , which involves starting with a vision of a desired future state and working backwards to identify the steps and milestones needed to achieve it. By focusing on the end goal and reverse-engineering the path to get there, organizations can break free from the constraints of short-term thinking and incremental progress.\n\nThe Apollo program, which landed the first humans on the moon in 1969, is a prime example of backcasting in action. When President John F. Kennedy announced the goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth before the end of the decade, it was an audacious vision that seemed almost impossible given the state of technology at the time. However, by working backwards from this goal, NASA was able to identify the key challenges and milestones that needed to be overcome, from developing new rocket engines and life support systems to mastering orbital rendezvous and lunar landing techniques. By breaking the problem down into smaller, achievable steps, NASA was able to make steady progress towards the ultimate goal, and achieve one of the greatest feats in human history.\n\nTo apply backcasting in practice, organizations should start by defining a clear and compelling vision of the future they want to create, based on their values, purpose, and aspirations. They should then work backwards to identify the key milestones and prerequisites that would need to be achieved along the way, as well as the potential barriers and obstacles that could hinder progress. By developing a roadmap and action plan based on this analysis, organizations can create a clear and strategic path forward, and rally stakeholders around a shared vision of the future.\n\nIn a world of increasing complexity and uncertainty, the ability to bounce back from setbacks and adapt to changing circumstances is more important than ever. Historically, the most successful and enduring organizations have been those that have cultivated a culture of resilience and adaptation, one that embraces change as an opportunity for growth and transformation.\n\nConsider the case of Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications giant that dominated the mobile phone industry in the early 2000s. Despite its market leadership, Nokia failed to anticipate the disruptive potential of smartphones and was slow to adapt to the changing competitive landscape. As a result, the company lost significant market share to more agile rivals like Apple and Samsung, and ultimately sold off its mobile phone business in 2014. In contrast, companies like Amazon and Netflix have thrived in the face of disruption by continuously experimenting with new business models and technologies, and by fostering a culture of innovation and customer-centricity.\n\nThe U.S. military is another example of an organization that has prioritized resilience and adaptation in the face of complex challenges. Through training programs like the \"Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape\" (SERE) course, soldiers and pilots learn how to maintain physical and mental resilience in high-stress situations, such as being captured by enemy forces. By building these skills into its culture and operations, the military is better equipped to adapt to the unpredictable and ever-changing nature of modern warfare.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has provided a stark reminder of the importance of resilience and adaptation in the face of disruption. While some organizations were able to quickly pivot to remote work and digital business models, others struggled to adapt and were forced to shut down or lay off workers. Those that were able to thrive in the face of the pandemic often had pre-existing capabilities and cultures that enabled them to be more agile and responsive, such as distributed teams, cloud-based infrastructure, and a willingness to experiment and iterate.\n\nTo cultivate resilience and adaptation in practice, organizations should start by assessing their current capabilities and vulnerabilities, and identifying areas for improvement. They should then invest in building the skills, structures, and mindsets that enable them to be more agile and responsive to change, such as cross-functional collaboration, rapid prototyping, and continuous learning. By embedding resilience and adaptation into their core operations and strategies, organisations can position themselves to thrive in the face of any disruption that comes their way.\n\nFinally, navigating the complexities of the future requires the ability to draw insights and approaches from multiple disciplines and fields of knowledge. From history and psychology to economics and computer science, each domain offers valuable perspectives and tools for understanding and shaping the world around us.\n\nThe field of biomimicry is a prime example of the power of interdisciplinary thinking . By studying how natural systems have evolved to solve complex problems, biomimicry practitioners have developed innovative solutions in fields ranging from architecture and engineering to medicine and materials science. For example, the Japanese bullet train was redesigned based on the streamlined shape of a kingfisher's beak, allowing it to travel faster and more efficiently while also reducing noise pollution.\n\nAnother example of interdisciplinary thinking in action is the field of behavioral economics, which combines insights from psychology and economics to better understand and predict human decision-making. By studying how people actually behave in real-world situations, rather than assuming perfect rationality, behavioural economists have developed new frameworks and interventions for addressing challenges like retirement savings, health behaviours, and climate change mitigation.\n\nTo cultivate interdisciplinary thinking in practice, organizations should start by building diverse teams and networks that bring together people with different backgrounds, skills, and perspectives. They should also invest in cross-training and learning opportunities that expose people to new ideas and approaches, and encourage them to think outside the box. By fostering a culture of curiosity, experimentation, and collaboration, organizations can tap into the power of interdisciplinary thinking to solve complex problems and create value in new and unexpected ways.\n\nAs we've seen throughout this article, navigating the future requires a multifaceted approach that draws on insights and strategies from a range of disciplines and domains. By embracing techniques like scenario planning and backcasting, cultivating resilience and adaptation, and fostering interdisciplinary thinking, we can improve our ability to anticipate and shape the future, even in the face of great uncertainty and change. While the future may always remain partly unknown, by learning from the past and applying the tools and frameworks of strategic foresight, we can approach it with greater confidence, creativity, and impact.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nThroughout this article, we have explored the complex art and science of predicting the future, drawing on insights from multiple disciplines. We have seen how cognitive biases, cultural norms, technological disruption, and societal values all shape our ability to anticipate and navigate change.\n\nHistorical case studies have revealed the far-reaching and often unpredictable consequences of technological change, while also highlighting the pitfalls of psychological biases in our predictions and decisions. Yet, we have also discovered powerful strategies and frameworks for navigating uncertainty, from scenario planning and backcasting to cultivating resilience and interdisciplinary thinking.\n\nAs we look ahead, the accelerating pace of change, driven by exponential technological advances and increasing global complexity, makes the ability to anticipate and adapt more crucial than ever. Thriving in this landscape will require new skills and mindsets, grounded in a deep understanding of history, a healthy skepticism of our biases, and a willingness to embrace uncertainty and experimentation.\n\nThe Fusion of Revolutionary Technologies: Unlocking Humanity's Greatest Transformation",

Over 2.5 million jobs have been reshored or created through foreign direct investment in the US since 2010, with 2023 and 2024 recording the highest annual totals ever.\n\nThis is not a temporary policy fad. It is a return to the historical norm. For most of the past five centuries, every nation that became powerful did so by protecting and building its domestic manufacturing base. The brief period of genuine free trade enthusiasm -- roughly 1980 to 2015 -- was the aberration, not the rule. Understanding why requires going back to the beginning.\n\nPart 1: The Mercantilist Foundations of Western Power\n\nThe story of Western economic dominance begins not with free trade but with its opposite: state-directed, protectionist, mercantilist industrial policy.\n\nIn the 1400s and 1500s, European merchants banded together to form joint stock companies that were granted monopoly rights over specific markets and regions by their governments. The English East India Company, established in 1600, eventually came to dominate the Indian subcontinent. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) controlled the spice trade. The Virginia Company colonised the eastern seaboard of North America. The French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Scandinavians all had equivalent organisations.\n\nThese companies were violently anti-competitive. Going abroad was expensive and dangerous. Once a trading post was established, the last thing any company wanted was a competitor showing up. They maintained private armies and armed merchantmen to enforce their monopolies. The state was fully behind this: colonies existed to supply raw materials and to serve as captive markets for the mother country's manufactured goods.\n\nThis was not an accident or a moral failing. It was a rational strategy for wealth accumulation. Raw materials are cheap. Manufactured goods are expensive. If you can force your colonies to sell you cheap cotton and buy back expensive cloth, you capture the value added by manufacturing. The wealth differential compounds over time. This is how tiny European nations came to dominate continents with vastly larger populations.\n\nThe American colonies experienced this system from the receiving end. All shipping to North America had to be carried on British ships. The manufacture of many goods was banned in the colonies. George Washington's personal correspondence is full of complaints about the high cost, low quality, and late delivery of goods from England. One of the principal economic grievances behind the American Revolution was the mercantilist system itself -- the colonists wanted to manufacture their own goods and trade freely with whomever they chose.\n\nPart 2: Hamilton's Playbook -- How America Built Itself\n\nWhat happened after American independence is one of the most important and least understood episodes in economic history. The United States did not embrace free trade. It did the opposite.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, submitted his \"Report on Manufactures\" to Congress in 1791. It is one of the most consequential economic documents ever written, and it explicitly rejected the free trade theories of Adam Smith. Hamilton argued that a young nation could not compete against established industrial powers on equal terms. British manufacturers had decades of accumulated expertise, capital, and scale. American manufacturers had none of these things. In a free market, British goods would flood America, American infant industries would be crushed in the cradle, and the United States would remain a raw materials exporter -- a colony in all but name.\n\nHamilton's solution was comprehensive: high tariffs on imported manufactured goods, government subsidies for domestic manufacturers, investment in infrastructure (roads, canals, ports), and the active recruitment of skilled workers and industrial secrets from Britain. He understood that manufacturing was not just about economics. It was about national sovereignty. A nation that cannot make its own goods cannot arm its own soldiers, equip its own navy, or sustain itself in a crisis.\n\nCongress adopted Hamilton's programme. The United States became the most protectionist major economy in the world and remained so for over 150 years. Average US tariff rates on manufactured goods ranged from 35% to 50% for most of the period between 1816 and 1945. During this time, the United States went from a marginal agricultural economy to the largest industrial power on Earth.\n\nThis was not a coincidence. It was the plan.\n\nThe German economist Friedrich List, writing in the 1840s, made the same argument even more forcefully. List had lived in the United States and had seen Hamilton's system in action. He returned to Germany and argued that free trade was a strategy employed by already-industrialised nations to prevent others from catching up. Britain, he noted, had used protectionism and state support to build its industrial base, and only began advocating free trade once it had an unbeatable competitive advantage. Free trade, List wrote, was \"kicking away the ladder\" -- climbing to the top using protectionist policies and then telling everyone else that ladders were inefficient.\n\nList's analysis was devastatingly accurate. Britain only became a champion of free trade after the Industrial Revolution had given it manufacturing capabilities that no other nation could match. If you can produce goods that are cheaper, better, and in greater quantities than anyone else, you effectively have a monopoly. The only thing preventing you from selling everywhere is other countries' tariff barriers. So you campaign to tear those barriers down -- not because you believe in free competition, but because you know you will win.\n\nPart 3: The Free Trade Aberration (1945-2015)\n\nIf protectionism built every major industrial power in history, why did the West abandon it?\n\nThe answer is the Cold War. After 1945, the United States found itself in an existential struggle with the Soviet Union. America needed allies -- lots of them, quickly. The most effective way to bind nations to the Western bloc was through economic integration. The Marshall Plan rebuilt Western Europe. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organisation (WTO) progressively lowered trade barriers. The United States deliberately opened its domestic market to allies like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and West Germany, accepting trade deficits as the price of geopolitical loyalty.\n\nThis was not free trade in any classical sense. It was a strategic subsidy. America was trading manufacturing jobs for military alliances. For as long as the Soviet threat existed, this bargain made sense. American workers who lost factory jobs could find employment in the expanding service sector, and the geopolitical benefits of a united Western bloc outweighed the economic costs.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 should have prompted a reassessment of this bargain. Instead, it produced a burst of ideological triumphalism. Free trade was no longer a Cold War strategy -- it became an article of faith. Francis Fukuyama declared the \"end of history.\" The Washington Consensus promoted trade liberalisation, deregulation, and privatisation as universal prescriptions for economic development. China was admitted to the WTO in 2001 on the assumption that trade would liberalise its political system.\n\nWestern companies rushed into China, eager to exploit cheap labour. They built factories, trained Chinese workers, transferred technology -- sometimes voluntarily, sometimes under coercion from the Chinese government, which required joint ventures and technology sharing as conditions of market access. For a brief period, the arrangement appeared to work. Western consumers got cheap goods. Chinese workers got jobs. Everyone seemed to be getting richer.\n\nBut the theory of comparative advantage, which underpinned this system, assumed that countries would specialise in what they were good at. China was supposed to make cheap toys and textiles. The West was supposed to make advanced technology and provide high-value services. Instead, China systematically moved up the value chain. One by one, Chinese companies -- backed by massive state subsidies, cheap credit, and stolen intellectual property -- began to dominate sector after sector: steel, solar panels, shipbuilding, telecommunications equipment, electric vehicles, batteries, and increasingly semiconductors and artificial intelligence.\n\nBy 2018, China was the world's largest manufacturer and the world's largest exporter. The theory of comparative advantage had not just failed. It had been weaponised against the nations that believed in it.\n\nPart 4: The Reckoning\n\nThe consequences of forty years of deindustrialisation are now impossible to ignore.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the European Union pledged to deliver one million artillery shells to Ukraine within a year. It could not meet the target. Europe's combined GDP was over ten times Russia's, but it could produce a fraction of Russia's military output. The problem was not money. It was capacity. The factories, the skilled workers, the supply chains -- all had been dismantled during three decades of \"peace dividend\" and offshoring.\n\nThe United States discovered similar vulnerabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, America could not produce enough surgical masks, ventilators, or basic pharmaceuticals. The richest nation in history was dependent on China for the most elementary medical supplies. The strategic implications were obvious and terrifying: in a serious conflict with China, the United States would be fighting a war while dependent on its adversary for critical supplies.\n\nThomas Sowell observed decades ago that the real cost of a policy is not what it costs in money but what it costs in alternatives foregone. The real cost of free trade was not measured in cheaper consumer goods. It was measured in the millions of manufacturing jobs lost, the communities hollowed out, the skills that disappeared, the supply chains that moved offshore, and the strategic dependencies that were created. The cheap television from China cost less at the checkout. But the factory that closed, the town that died, the workers who never found equivalent employment, the tax base that evaporated, and the military vulnerability that was created -- these costs were never on the price tag.\n\nPart 5: The Return\n\nWhat is happening now is not a policy experiment. It is a correction -- a return to the historical norm after a forty-year aberration.\n\nThe United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods ranging from 15% to over 100% on specific categories. The CHIPS Act provides $52 billion in subsidies for domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The Inflation Reduction Act channels hundreds of billions into domestic clean energy manufacturing. The US-Taiwan deal of February 2026 is explicitly designed to bring semiconductor production onto American soil.\n\nEurope is following, albeit more slowly. The EU's European Chips Act aims to double Europe's share of global semiconductor production. Individual nations are offering subsidies to attract battery factories, pharmaceutical plants, and defence manufacturers. Even Germany, the high priest of free trade within Europe, has begun to talk about \"strategic autonomy\" and \"de-risking\" supply chains.\n\nThe critical enabler of this reshoring revolution is technology. In the 1990s and 2000s, the economic case for offshoring was simple: labour in China cost a fraction of labour in the West, and the savings more than offset the costs of shipping goods across the Pacific. But AI and robotics are rapidly eliminating the labour cost advantage. A factory staffed by robots costs roughly the same to operate whether it is in Ohio or Guangdong. If the labour cost differential disappears, the case for manufacturing close to the end consumer -- avoiding shipping costs, tariff risks, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical dependencies -- becomes overwhelming.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts predict that 2026 marks an inflection point: companies are first investing in automation and productivity upgrades to maximise existing facilities, positioning themselves for larger greenfield factory construction as the economics shift decisively in favour of domestic production.\n\nPart 6: What Comes Next\n\nHistory suggests where this leads.\n\nThe 2020s through the 2040s will see a return to something resembling nineteenth-century industrial policy across the developed world. Tariffs, subsidies, state-directed investment in strategic sectors, and active efforts to recruit or develop critical technologies will become the norm, not the exception. The language will be different -- \"strategic autonomy,\" \"supply chain resilience,\" \"friend-shoring\" -- but the substance will be the same mercantilism that Hamilton, List, and Colbert would recognise instantly.\n\nNations that rebuild their manufacturing base will find themselves stronger, more resilient, and more sovereign. They will be able to arm their own militaries, supply their own hospitals, and sustain their own populations in a crisis. They will also find that manufacturing creates a virtuous cycle: factories require skilled workers, skilled workers require education and training, education and training create innovation, and innovation creates new industries. This is the cycle that made Britain, America, Germany, and Japan great. It is the cycle that China has been running for thirty years while the West was busy congratulating itself on its service economy.\n\nNations that fail to rebuild will find themselves in the position of late Rome: wealthy on paper, dependent on others for the goods they need, and strategically vulnerable to any disruption in the supply of those goods. Rome did not fall because it was poor. It fell because it had outsourced its military to Germanic mercenaries and its agriculture to slave-worked latifundia, and when the system was disrupted, there was nothing underneath.\n\nThe Ricardian theory of comparative advantage will not disappear from economics textbooks. But it will increasingly be taught as a historical curiosity -- a theory that described a brief and unusual period in which one group of nations was so dominant that they could afford to pretend that the rules did not apply to them. The rules always applied. They just took forty years to reassert themselves.\n\nThe factories are coming back. The question is not whether, but which nations will build them fast enough.\n\nThe Paradox of Mass Migration and Robots in the Age of Automation",

Birth rates are below replacement level everywhere. Populations are ageing. The ratio of working-age adults to retirees is collapsing. The welfare state, the pension system, the healthcare system, and the tax base all depend on there being enough young, productive workers to support a growing number of elderly dependents.\n\nThe standard response has been mass immigration. The logic is straightforward: if your own citizens will not have enough children, import young workers from countries that still do. This has been the de facto policy of virtually every Western government for the past three decades.\n\nHistory Future Now has written extensively about why this does not work. This article takes the argument to its conclusion: there is now an alternative. That alternative is the robot. And the choice between the immigrant and the robot will define the political, economic, and cultural trajectory of every developed nation for the next fifty years.\n\nPart 1: Rome's Labour Crisis\n\nThe demographic crisis facing the modern West is not unprecedented. The Roman Empire faced an almost identical problem two thousand years ago -- and its response to that problem ultimately destroyed it.\n\nBy the first century BC, Roman citizens were having fewer children. Augustus, the first emperor, was so alarmed that in 18 BC he passed the Lex Julia de Maritandis Ordinibus -- a comprehensive package of laws designed to encourage marriage and childbearing. Unmarried citizens were penalised. Parents of three or more children received tax breaks and preferential access to public office. Adultery was criminalised. Augustus understood that the legions, the tax base, and Roman identity itself depended on Romans producing the next generation.\n\nThe laws failed. Roman citizens continued to have fewer children. The reasons were strikingly similar to those driving modern fertility decline: rising costs of child-rearing, alternative lifestyles, urbanisation (which reduces the economic value of children), and a cultural shift toward individual fulfilment over familial duty.\n\nRome's response to this labour shortage set in motion the chain of events that would eventually destroy the Western Empire. Unable to recruit enough Roman citizens for the legions, the empire increasingly relied on Germanic foederati -- allied barbarian warriors who served in exchange for land, money, and the right to settle within the empire's borders. Unable to find enough Roman workers for its farms and workshops, the empire relied on slaves and, later, on settled barbarian communities.\n\nFor a while, this worked. The Germanic soldiers were often excellent fighters. The settled communities paid taxes and contributed to the economy. But the foederati had their own leaders, their own loyalties, and their own interests. They were not Romans. They did not share Roman culture, Roman law, or Roman identity. As their numbers grew, the empire became increasingly dependent on people who had no fundamental attachment to the thing they were defending.\n\nBy the fifth century, the Roman army was largely Germanic. Many of the empire's top military commanders were of barbarian origin. The people who controlled the military were not the people who had built the civilisation. When the system came under pressure -- as it did with the Hunnic invasions and the cascading crises of the fifth century -- the foederati made their own arrangements. The last Western Roman emperor was deposed in 476 AD by Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain who had been serving in the Roman army. The empire had been replaced from within by the very people it had imported to sustain itself.\n\nPart 2: The Ottoman Millet System\n\nThe Ottoman Empire took a different approach to managing its multi-ethnic population, and the results were equally instructive.\n\nThe millet system divided Ottoman society into self-governing religious communities -- the Muslim millet, the Greek Orthodox millet, the Armenian millet, the Jewish millet, and others. Each millet was governed by its own religious leaders according to its own laws in matters of personal status (marriage, divorce, inheritance, education). The communities coexisted within the same empire but lived largely separate lives.\n\nFor centuries, this system provided stability. The Ottoman Empire was one of the most successful multi-ethnic polities in history, controlling southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa for over 600 years. But the millet system contained the seeds of its own destruction: by keeping communities separate and allowing them to maintain distinct identities, it ensured that when the pressures of modernity arrived -- nationalism, mass literacy, democratic ideas -- each community had the cultural infrastructure to demand its own nation-state.\n\nThe nineteenth century saw one millet after another break away. Greece won independence in 1830. Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria followed. The Arab Revolt of 1916-1918 detached the Middle East. The Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 stripped the empire of almost all its European territory. The empire that had managed diversity through separation was torn apart by the very identities it had preserved.\n\nThe parallel with modern multiculturalism is uncomfortable but direct. Western nations have, since the 1960s, adopted an approach to immigration that resembles the millet system: distinct communities are encouraged to maintain their own cultural identities, languages, religious practices, and social norms within the borders of the host nation. The assumption is that these communities will coexist harmoniously under a shared civic framework. But if the Ottoman experience is any guide, communities that maintain strong separate identities within a single polity will eventually assert those identities against the polity itself -- especially when they reach sufficient demographic weight.\n\nPart 3: The British Empire's Indentured Labour Legacy\n\nAfter the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire in 1833, plantation owners in the Caribbean, Fiji, South Africa, Malaysia, and elsewhere faced an acute labour shortage. The former slaves, unsurprisingly, were not eager to continue working on the same plantations under only marginally better conditions.\n\nThe solution was indentured labour from India. Between 1834 and 1920, approximately 2 million Indians were transported to British colonies around the world under contracts that bound them to work for a fixed period (usually five years) in exchange for passage, food, and a small wage. The system was, in many respects, slavery by another name -- the conditions were harsh, the contracts were coercive, and the workers had few practical rights.\n\nThe short-term economic problem was solved. The plantations had their labour. The sugar, tea, rubber, and other commodities continued to flow. The colonial economies functioned.\n\nThe long-term consequences are still with us. In Fiji, the Indian-descended population grew to nearly 50% of the total, creating ethnic tensions that have produced four coups since 1987. In Trinidad and Tobago, the population is roughly evenly split between African-descended and Indian-descended communities, with politics organised almost entirely along ethnic lines. In Guyana, the same ethnic division has produced chronic political instability. In Malaysia, the relationship between the Malay majority and the Indian and Chinese minorities remains a central fault line in national politics.\n\nIn every case, the labour shortage was solved. In every case, the solution created a permanent ethnic division that has proved impossible to resolve. The descendants of the imported workers did not assimilate. They maintained their own identities, their own communities, and their own political interests. The host societies were permanently transformed -- not in the way that anyone planned, and not in a way that anyone would have chosen.\n\nPart 4: Japan's Choice\n\nJapan's post-war approach to the same set of challenges provides the single most important counter-example in modern history.\n\nJapan faced, and faces, the same demographic crisis as every other developed nation: a fertility rate well below replacement (currently 1.20), a rapidly ageing population, and a shrinking workforce. The economic pressures are identical to those in Europe and the United States. The demand for labour -- in manufacturing, eldercare, agriculture, and services -- is acute and growing.\n\nBut Japan made a different choice. Where other nations imported workers, Japan imported machines. Japan has the highest robot density in the world -- 399 industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers, compared to 285 in Germany and 255 in the United States. Japanese companies are world leaders in industrial automation, and the Japanese government has actively promoted robotics as the solution to labour shortages since the 1980s.\n\nJapan also maintained extremely restrictive immigration policies. Foreign-born residents constitute less than 3% of Japan's population, compared to 14% in the United States, 15% in Germany, and over 20% in Switzerland and Australia. This was a deliberate choice, made consistently across decades by governments of different political orientations.\n\nThe results are debatable. Japan's economic growth has been sluggish since the 1990s -- the \"Lost Decades\" -- and its GDP per capita has fallen relative to other developed nations. Critics argue that Japan's restrictive immigration policy has contributed to this stagnation by limiting the labour supply and reducing the dynamism that immigrants bring.\n\nBut consider what Japan has preserved. Social cohesion remains extraordinarily high. Crime rates are among the lowest in the world. Trust in institutions, while declining, remains far higher than in most Western nations. There are no ethnic ghettos, no parallel societies, no identity-based political parties, no integration debates, and no terrorism driven by failures of assimilation. Japanese cities are safe, clean, and functional. The cultural identity of the nation is intact.\n\nThomas Sowell has argued that the economic contribution of immigrants is often overstated, while the social costs -- wage depression for native workers, strain on public services, erosion of social trust -- are systematically understated. Japan's experience suggests that a nation can maintain a high standard of living, a functioning society, and a coherent national identity without mass immigration -- provided it is willing to invest in the technology that replaces the labour that immigrants would have provided.\n\nPart 5: The Robot Arrives\n\nThe technology that Japan pioneered is now reaching a tipping point that will transform the entire debate.\n\nIndustrial robots have been used in manufacturing since the 1960s. But they were expensive, inflexible, and limited to specific repetitive tasks in controlled environments. They could weld car panels and paint bodywork, but they could not care for an elderly person, stock supermarket shelves, or clean a hotel room.\n\nThat is changing with extraordinary speed. General-purpose humanoid robots -- machines designed to operate in unstructured human environments, performing a wide range of physical tasks -- are moving from science fiction to commercial reality.\n\nTesla's Optimus robot is designed to perform tasks ranging from factory work to elder care, with a target price point below $20,000. Figure.ai's Figure 01, backed by partnerships with OpenAI, demonstrates robots that can hold conversations while performing physical tasks. Unitree's H1 holds the record for the fastest bipedal robot. Boston Dynamics' Atlas can perform gymnastics that most humans cannot. Chinese companies, leveraging their dominance in electric vehicle manufacturing (which shares many components with humanoid robots), are entering the field rapidly.\n\nAt a price point of $20,000 or less -- roughly equivalent to a year's wages for a low-skilled worker in many Western countries -- the economic case for humanoid robots becomes irresistible. A robot that costs $20,000, operates 24 hours a day, requires no salary, no benefits, no housing, no healthcare, no pension, and no return ticket is simply cheaper than any human worker, regardless of where that human comes from.\n\nIn parallel, AI is transforming white-collar work. Microsoft's AI chief predicts automation of virtually all white-collar tasks within 18 months. Even if this timeline proves optimistic by a factor of five, the direction is clear. AI systems will progressively take over the cognitive tasks -- legal research, financial analysis, medical diagnosis, software development, content creation -- that have been the mainstay of middle-class employment in developed economies.\n\nTogether, humanoid robots and AI will provide an alternative to mass immigration that did not exist even a decade ago. The demographic crisis is real. The dependency ratio will not fix itself. Ageing nations need workers. But for the first time in history, those workers do not have to be human.\n\nPart 6: What Comes Next\n\nThe 2030s will present every ageing nation with a binary choice that cannot be avoided or fudged: import people, or import robots.\n\nThere is no third option. The fertility rates are too low and have been too low for too long. No country in human history has recovered from a sustained fertility rate below 1.5. Pro-natalist policies -- cash bonuses, tax breaks, subsidised childcare -- have been tried in virtually every developed nation and have produced, at best, marginal and temporary increases. The demographic trajectory is set for the next thirty years, because the women who will be of childbearing age in 2040 have already been born -- and there are not enough of them.\n\nNations that choose robots will face challenges. They will need to solve the problem of distributing the wealth that robots create -- if robots produce the goods but do not earn wages, the old model of \"work for money, money for goods\" breaks down. New forms of taxation (perhaps a robot tax, or a tax on AI-generated productivity), new models of wealth distribution, and new conceptions of the purpose of human life in a post-labour economy will be required. These are serious challenges, but they are engineering problems with engineering solutions.\n\nNations that choose mass immigration will face the same fate as every multi-ethnic empire in history. The Roman foederati replaced the Romans. The Ottoman millets tore the empire apart. The British Empire's indentured labour created permanent ethnic divisions. The pattern is consistent across millennia and civilisations: importing a large population with a different culture, language, religion, and identity to solve a short-term economic problem creates a long-term political and social problem that proves far more costly than the original economic challenge.\n\nMoreover, the economic case for mass immigration is already weaker than its proponents claim. Data from Finland, the Netherlands, and the United States consistently shows that many immigrant groups represent a net fiscal cost -- they receive more in public services and welfare than they contribute in taxes. The argument that immigration is necessary to sustain the welfare state and the pension system is, in many cases, arithmetically false. If the immigrants arriving cost more than they contribute, then immigration is not filling the demographic hole. It is making it deeper.\n\nThe robot bargain is this: accept the machine, maintain social cohesion, preserve cultural identity, and solve the distribution problem. Or accept the stranger, solve the immediate labour shortage, and inherit the ethnic, cultural, and political divisions that have destroyed every multi-ethnic polity in history.\n\nJapan has shown that the first path is viable. Rome has shown where the second path leads.\n\nThe humanoid robot at $20,000 will make the economic argument for mass immigration completely obsolete within a decade. What will remain is a moral argument -- that nations have an obligation to accept immigrants regardless of the consequences. That argument will be made. It will be made loudly and passionately. And it will lose, because democratic majorities in every developed nation have consistently shown that they prefer social cohesion, cultural continuity, and national identity to abstract moral obligations defined by people who do not bear the costs.\n\nThe robots are coming. They are coming faster than almost anyone expected. And they offer ageing nations something that no previous technology could: a way to solve the dependency crisis without importing the dependencies that destroyed Rome.\n\nThe choice, for the first time in two thousand years, is real. History suggests which option to take.\n\nThe Paradox Of Mass Migration And Robots In The Age Of Automation",

These detrimental effects were experienced not just in societies that were being industrialised, but also in countries that did not industrialise at all.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, starting in Great Britain resulted in widespread pain and unemployment, followed by significant prosperity and a golden age for those countries that experienced it first. People who live in the developed world today have inherited a world that was built on an early entrant advantage over the rest of the world and have forgotten the initial growing pains. We have a material quality of life that is perhaps the highest it has been in history. We are lucky. Few of us would choose to live in 1800, rather than in 2012.\n\nIn this chapter we will go back to the first Industrial Revolution, starting in 1776, and follows the impact of rapid changes on employment for people in the West, and in the rest of the world. We show why the technology driven second Industrial Revolution will be as uncomfortable as the first revolution.\n\nThe Scotsman Adam Smith was writing in 1776, the same year as the US Declaration of Independence, he described a world that was on the cusp of industrialisation. He made references to items such as nails being produced on a production line. Forty years later, in 1817, industrialisation was accelerating, prompting David Ricardo to write about the comparative advantages of nations. Ricardo suggested that certain nations should engage in high value activities and other nations in low value activities. These two writers formed the intellectual basis of the interlinked concepts of industrialisation, capitalism and free trade.\n\nWhen you read these books and also novels of the time, it is clear that industrialisation was extremely painful for many people. Why? It made people who had previously been gainfully employed suddenly become unemployed. The 1811-1817 Luddite movement, now permanently synonymous with backwards thinking people, was a symptom of a serious social crisis. Millions of people moved from the countryside into the cities. In the countryside they had had farming, garden farming and cottage industry to sustain them economically. While life was no picnic before, being evicted from your land and being forced to work in an early 19th century factory, or being forced into prostitution was much worse. This process was not quick. It was not a brief revolution then followed by years of prosperity. The evolution lasted from the late 1700s to the end of the Second World War: over 150 years.\n\nEurope was convulsed during this period by multiple revolutions and upheavals. The French Revolution, inspired by the French backed American Revolution, set the stage for the concept of nationalism with the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1848 multiple governments across Europe were toppled by revolutions. Many of these revolutions were caused by an influx of new ideas, increased mechanisation and a consequent drop in the numbers of jobs. This process accelerated towards the second half of the 19th century and saw millions of Europeans flee conditions at home for lives of hoped for prosperity in America, Canada, Argentina and eventually Australia. Life in Europe had become unbearable and the value of life had dropped with it. 19th century European factories were allowed to be so inhuman and awful because the products that they produced were so cheap. Cheap products destroyed all of the cottage industries and jobs that had previously existed, leaving people with few alternatives.\n\nAnd this degree of pain was for the successful, early industrialising countries. The rest of the world had it even worse: subjugation and colonisation by the rich industrialised nations.\n\nChina and India had had the largest populations on Earth for a long time. In a pre industrial world, where there were few machines, there was a simple economic truth: if you had more people you could produce more things. The more you could produce the more wealth for the economy. China was a major manufacturing hub of the world and produced goods that were in significant demand in the West. When the Eastern Roman Empire's capital Constantinople fell to the Turks in 1453, and closed off the silk road to China, it set off a wave of innovation in Western Europe as city states and small countries tried to find a way to get back into the vast Chinese and Asian markets. Early adoption of cheap guns enabled small European countries with surprisingly few people. to dominate other wealthier and more populous countries. These countries used this power to control markets and purchase goods. Spices and manufactured goods, paid for by Latin American silver and gold (the Spanish and Portuguese empires), innovative corporate structures (the Dutch empire) and finally the sale of early manufactured goods (the British empire).\n\nIt was the final group, the British, who radically changed the lives of people living within India and China. British power then resulted in a military and political dominance over Africa (resources and slaves) and Asia (captive markets for industrialised products). Ricardo's comparative advantage and Smith's free trade crushed the spirit and the economies of the rest of the world. Britain and the industrialised west could produce products that were comparatively better and cheaper than those of their competition. China refused to import any more products as they were worried about the destabilising impact of cheap Western goods on their economy. The West responded to this by smuggling opium into China in huge quantities. As China became increasingly unstable, Western warships bombed Chinese towns and cities until the Chinese signed up to the Unequal Treaties of the 19th and early 20th centuries which permitted Western powers to sell manufactured goods in mainland China. China was reduced to a semi colonial status and was forced to lease Hong Kong to Great Britain and Macau to Portugal.\n\nSo looking back in history, it is clear that the use of the word \"revolution\" in the context of Industrial Revolution does not refer to something warm and benign, but rather a violent convulsion which upset the global balance of power and the societies that lived through it.\n\nSo if increased automation, 3D printing, and computerisation are forming the basis of a new Industrial Revolution that has the potential to be as radical as the first Industrial Revolution, what are people and societies to do? The view that all a society needs to do is invest in education and things will be okay, is wrong. Potentially this attitude abandons a large chunk of society.\n\nWhy? Firstly, in any country there will be a standard mix of smart people, hardworking people, and stupid or lazy people. No matter how hard you try as a government to persuade companies otherwise, stupid or lazy people will always be less attractive to employers than smart and/or hardworking people. As companies can hire people from all over the world, they will rather pick smart and hardworking people from other countries than pick stupid and lazy people from their own country. So what happens to all of the stupid and lazy people? Just because you are stupid, or lazy, or both, should you be condemned to a life of misery and unemployment? Education may help you move up a little in the employment pecking order but remember: we are all now competing with the entire planet's population. This is a terrible outcome for you as an individual and just as destabilising for your country as a whole.\n\nSecondly, a highly educated population does not create that many jobs, when compared to the numbers that were available in primary and secondary industries and in parts of the service industry. Google, Apple and Microsoft are great technological giants but hire relatively few people, even if you include people who work within their ecosystems. Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturing giant with over 480,000 employees, which produces goods for these three technology companies is a big employer today but even now the company is planning to automate thousands of jobs with robots.\n\nSo if education is no panacea, what are we to do? Stop free trade? Become autarchic? De-industrialise? Reduce computerisation and mechanisation? King Canute is famous because he sat on his throne and commanded the tide to not come up the beach. People today remember this part of the story and Canute is mocked, as of course he could not stop the tide from reaching up to his throne and wetting his clothes. People forget the beginning of the story, however. Canute was so fed up with the flattery of all of his courtiers, who told him that anything that he commanded would come true, that it was he who decided to mock their flattery by telling them that he could turn back the tide.\n\nLike Canute, in our story of the second Industrial Revolution, there is nothing that we can do to turn back this tide of innovation, automation and computerisation. In fact, our problems may be even worse than in the first wave of industrialisation. Unlike in the 19th century, we have no population release valve in the form of an empty continent presided over by a government willing to welcome the huddled masses of people whose lives have been upturned by industrialisation.\n\nJobs: First, Get Rid Of Expensive Westerners.

A large number of the products and services produced in Asia have been exported back to Europe and America.\n\nFor many this is clearly a good thing. Asia is becoming more affluent and millions of people have been pulled out of poverty. For others this is a bad thing. The trend causes a huge trade imbalance for the West, which helped to fuel the debt crisis. The practice has also created more global pollution as cleaner Western factories have been closed down and replaced by Asian factories powered by coal and producing 'dirtier' byproducts.\n\nFrom a Western perspective the main rationale for this form of outsourcing has been access to lower cost products. Once the practice had been adopted by a few companies to produce goods in places like China, which gave access to cheap land, cheap construction, and cheap labour, it became very difficult for other Western companies to compete. So they had to adapt as well.\n\nBut are these lower cost products really cheaper or is the lower cost merely an illusion? We frequently think that something is cheaper than it really is: printer companies routinely sell customers good quality laser printers for GBP 100; an amazing price. But not so cheap when you discover that new ink cartridges can cost almost the same amount. Consumers are offered \"free\" mobile phones and then are tied in to 24-36 month long contracts worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nHistory Future Now has looked at the cost of an imported product from a place like China and the impact of the 'cheap' products on higher levels of unemployment in Western societies. Some simple maths will show that the consumer may pay a low price for the imported product but this short term gain is offset by a much higher price. The cost is to fund fellow citizens who have no jobs and do not contribute taxes. It is important to look at the life cycle cost of products, not just the up front cost.\n\nLets have a closer look\n\nTo start with, lets admit it up front: many products that are built in China have a lower retail sales price than a competing product that is made somewhere in Europe.\n\nIf you add up the cost of cheaper land, cheaper buildings and cheaper labour, a GBP 100 laser printer imported from China may cost GBP 115 if it were built in the European Union or in the US. For people on a budget (most of us) this 15-20% increase in cost is a big deal. And when comparing nearly identical products, spending 15-20% more on a product just because it is made in your home country is not something that most people are willing (or able) to do.\n\nIf most of the growth in manufacturing and service sector jobs is in Asia, albeit to provide goods and services for people in the West, then the result is that there are fewer jobs in the West. Despite the efforts of economists to play down this issue, citing theories of comparative advantage, the reality is that unemployment in the West is a natural consequence of outsourcing. Under employment, is another major problem in the West as skilled jobs become scarce and people are overqualified for the jobs they are forced into doing.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, which provides statistics for the European Commission, the European Union 17 (those in the Euro-zone) had an average unemployment rate of 12.1% for all people of working age population in October 2013. Given the fact that Germany is the largest country in the EU17 and has an exceptionally low level of 5.2% the average for the EU17 excluding Germany is much higher. Greece and Spain, for example, have an unemployment rate of 27.3% and 26.7% respectively.\n\nRicardian theory of comparative advantage does not seem to be working any longer and, (See P-) possibly never worked in the past. If the theory worked in practice significantly lower levels of unemployment would be seen across the European Union as each worker would do the job to which they are best suited.\n\nSo lets get back on track.\n\nWhat is the cost of this unemployment on society? There are lots of ways of looking at it. We will take the most simplistic way, as it is should be less controversial, although it is likely to understate the true cost quite considerably.\n\nLets make a series of assumptions, based on the UK's economy. The average income is GBP 26,600 per annum, or GBP 2,217 per month. Of that 24% is taxed, resulting in a take home salary of GBP 20,216 per annum or GBP 1,685 per month. The critical part here is the amount of Income Tax: GBP 6,384. The actual amount deducted as tax is higher than this figure as companies pay Employer's National Insurance on top, but we will ignore it.\n\nIf you are unemployed in the UK the maximum amount you can get in benefits (from 2014) including housing and income support, is GBP 26,000. Curiously some of that is subject to tax. Thus if you do not work and depend on the State the full cost of those benefits to the government (i.e. taxpayers) is GBP 27,184. This is sum the total of benefits paid by the government to the citizen plus the cost of missed taxes not paid by the citizen to the government.\n\nIn the UK of a population of 64m people there are 33m people of working age. Of the working age population 2.5m are unemployed (7.6%). This results in a theoretical unemployment cost of GBP 67 billion per annum (2.5m x GBP 27k per annum). That means that of the 30m people in Britain who are working GBP 2,236 of the GBP 6,384 they pay in taxes (35%) goes to pay for those that are unemployed. That is a lot.\n\nIf, miraculously, there was no unemployment and that proportion of tax was returned to the working population, each would, theoretically, have an additional GBP 2,236 per year to spend on whatever they wanted. That is the equivalent of 1.3 months of additional salary per year. Returning to the laser printer example, it costs GBP 115 to build in the EU but GBP 100 to import from China. A GBP 15 difference. If the sole reason for EU unemployment is attributed to cheaper labour in China (which is an exaggeration) and if there was zero EU unemployment each worker could buy the labour only equivalent of 149 laser printers per year (149 x GBP 15 = GBP 2,236) from the EU rather than China without busting their personal budget. That is a lot of manufactured goods.\n\nUsing the same assumptions, but switching the unemployment rate to 12.1%, which is the average rate for the EU17, it would cost the UK GBP 107bn (vs GBP 67bn) to pay benefits to unemployed people. Thus 59% of all the personal income tax that employed people pay (GBP 3,742 of GBP 6,384) would be needed to pay for people that are unemployed. That is equivalent to 2.2 months of additional income per year.\n\nIt gets worse if you use Greece's unemployment rate of 27.3%. If the UK had this level of unemployment, 8.9 million out of the 32.6m working age population would have no job. It would cost taxpayers GBP 10,208 per year (GBP 242 billion) to foot the bill for the unemployed - a sum which is higher than the GBP 6,384 in tax an average worker currently pays. The cost to each worker for each non-worker would be equivalent to 6 months additional income per year. That is the equivalent of a huge number of low cost goods from China.\n\nThe UK's total budget for 2012-2013 was GBP 683bn so the cost of supporting unemployment at the current Greek level would devastate the UK's budget. At GBP 242 billion the cost of unemployment is only a little less than all the money spent on defense (GBP 39 billion), education (GBP 91 billion) and health (GBP 130 billion) put together.\n\nWhat is alarming is that youth unemployment in the European Union is significantly higher than total unemployment. The chart below shows the average youth unemployment rate for the EU as a whole and in the EU17 (Eurozone) in particular.\n\nIf you are young it is very hard to find a job. And if you can't find a job now you are less likely to find a well paid job in the future. This means that over time unemployment rates are likely to go up, not down.\n\nThese statistics show that the cost to society for unemployed people is likely to go up over time, resulting in permanently overstretched budgets and/or increased government borrowing. Alternatively unemployment benefits could be slashed. This solution would be likely to result in an increased budget requirement for law enforcement to control increasingly desperate people who would resort to crime to help make ends meet. More prisons would be needed to house all of those \"undesirable\" people at an additional cost.\n\nSo sure, a consumable product or service may be 10-15% cheaper using outsourced labour. But by focusing on the low cost of the product and ignoring the actual cost to us as an individual taxpayer we are fooling ourselves. It is exactly the same mindset that tricks people into buying cheap laser jet printers only to find that they require absurdly expensive ink cartridges, or into buying a product with a credit card without considering the resultant cost of an extra 27% interest per annum to your credit card company.\n\nBy examining the life-cycle cost this way it is clear that the cost of high levels of unemployment is more expensive to a citizen than the benefit of importing lower priced products.\n\nA final note.\n\nThis chapter focuses on the underlying cost of cheap versus the cost of high unemployment levels.\n\nIn the chapter Why do we need the military? we examine the cost of securing energy supplies and trade. The US spends $137 billion per year on its military in the Pacific, mainly on its navy, to secure open access of the Pacific and Indian Ocean to support commerce. But the US loses a huge amount every year in trade to Asian countries: $295 billion per year to China, $63 billion to Japan, $13 billion to South Korea, $15 billion to Taiwan and $14 billion to India, a total of $400 billion per year. This annual transfer of wealth, plus the military cost of transferring this wealth, amounts to a staggering $537 billion per year for the US and is the equivalent of $1,700 per American man, woman and child. This budget busting spending has contributed to the US's mindboggling private, commercial and government debt, all of which needs to be paid for at some point.\n\nIt is easy to understand why multinational companies are more than happy with outsourcing employment. Corporations need to compete with each other for market share, profit margins, customers etc. Getting your products to market cheaper by undercutting your competitor is likely to result in more sales. Companies don't want to worry about the external costs to society of their actions. - High unemployment, increased pollution, workers conditions are issues for the Government. As for paying taxes - especially when Corporations actively see themselves as transcending the nationality of their original home country - this is viewed solely as a cost to the bottom line not as a social obligation.\n\nIt is also easy to understand why individuals in the West are happy with the status quo. We can buy cheaper imported goods and services. And it is hard to make an explicit connection between the higher taxes and higher unemployment levels that result from it.\n\nHowever, it is a real mystery as to why so many Western politicians and economists promote a trading system that increases Western unemployment levels and results in a gigantic transfer of wealth to the East every year.\n\nThey ought to know better.\n\nKeynes And Hayek Are Both Dead, And Wrong",

Spying on a scale that our elected officials were supposedly unaware of, despite the political chain of command.\n\nThe Anti-Snowden group argues that Snowden is a naive idealist whose actions have made society more dangerous. The release of information, it is argued, provide terrorists with sufficient knowledge of the British and American security services to avoid detection when they hatch their heinous plots.\n\nThere are two fundamental flaws with the Anti-Snowden group argument: If you have nothing to hide, they argue, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nFirst, there are so many laws that are archaic and forgotten, that every single citizen is likely to break a law at some point. In addition, most people have some transgression in their personal lives they prefer to keep private.\n\nIn the first case those in control of the data might use it actively or passively against its citizens. If you are an elected politician, for instance, the chances are that you have done something wrong at some point in your life or have something private that you want to hide.\n\nSecurity services could use this information to \"screen\" politicians and their supporters. This has happened before. J. Edgar Hoover, as the founding Director of the FBI, until his death in 1972, had detailed files on many US politicians, including President Kennedy and President Harry Truman. Both considered firing him. Neither was brave enough. In the early 1950s Joseph McCarthy led a witch hunt of US civil servants, politicians, actors and the like, looking for alleged Communists. Their access to information was amateurish compared to what is possible by the NSA and GCHQ today.\n\nInformation can also be used passively, simply to inform a politician that records of misdemeanours exist can end a political career. The threat of exposure can be a subtle one, compromising a politician's stance on a particular issue. The NSA would possibly not be above using illegally gained material in this way.\n\nIn the next chapter we explore the concept of law breaking in order to further an important social cause. Slavery was legal in the US south until 1865. Women did not get the vote in the UK until 1928. African - Americans faced huge legalised forms of discrimination until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Interracial marriage only became legal in most US states in 1967. Homosexuality only became legal in all of the US in 2003.\n\nAll of these legal changes were preceded by civil strife. The activists who fought to change society were frequently breaking the law.\n\nImagine how hard it would be now to lead one of these movements. All of your communications with other supporters could be monitored.\n\nGovernment spies would know who is connected to who. They would know your private secrets. You could be either rounded up, or co-opted through blackmail.\n\nOccasionally the security services announce that a major terrorist plot has been discovered and stopped. We collectively breathe a sigh of relief at a near disaster avoided.\n\nBut the same tools that were used to stop those terrorists could have stopped women from getting the right to vote and black children from going to school with white children.\n\nSometimes change is needed. By allowing a few unelected people to have control over our secrets we may end up with a frozen, unchanging, society.\n\nThis is not a good thing.\n\nDon't Confuse What Is Legal With What Is Morally Right",

At root, this is a question of \"other\" - who is in and who is out.\n\nIn this article History Future Now looks at the concept of European racism through the lens of religion, race/ethnicity, power and economics. The conclusion may be surprising.\n\nDoes religion provide the blueprints for racism?\n\nPrior to the 1400s the concept of racism was not understood as Europeans hardly ever encountered other races. Religion, however, had established a sense of \"other\" from the 300s AD.\n\nPrior to that, mankind worshiped many gods and they were universal. Many of the gods developed out of the observable world: gods of water, fire, earthquakes, thunder, floods, sun and moon. The early classical world of the Mediterranean turned these animist spirits into anthropomorphic gods with human like personalities, captured so dramatically in Homer's Iliad and The Odyssey. Many of the gods from one part of the classical world were almost identical to those in other parts, but with different names and customs. One of the geniuses of the Roman Republic and early Roman Empire was their ability to synthesise local gods and to give them double barreled names - with a reference to the Roman version and local version of the god. This allowed new Roman subjects to worship their old gods and the new Romanised version of their old gods at the same time.\n\nJudaism was an anomaly. The Jewish god had morphed from a household god into what they believed to be the only god. This was particularly controversial when Jewish lands were incorporated into the Roman Empire in 6AD. On the one side you had a group - the Romans - who believed in lots of gods and were flirting with emperor worship and on the other side you had a group who believed in only one god - the Jews - and who, by extension, denied the existence of all other gods, including the emperor.\n\nThe Jews were ahead of their times. In the same way that the Romans recognised that their old gods had different names in other parts of the Roman Empire, they started to experiment with the idea that perhaps their different gods were, in fact, one god with different attributes. Perhaps spurred on by the new Jewish Christian sect, Sol Invictus (the unconquered sun), became one of the dominant new Gods within the Roman Empire, especially during the reign of Aurelian in 270-275AD. Emperor Constantine, who famously converted to Christianity on his deathbed, was a great fan of Sol Invictus and Christ was frequently depicted with many of the characteristics of Sol Invictus.\n\nThe Roman Republic's inclusive polytheism would eventually be replaced by the Roman Empire's exclusive monotheism. But even this monotheism was not monolithic as divisions rapidly emerged in the early Christian Church about the true nature of Christ and his relationship with God and the Holy Spirit. Regular churchgoers will be familiar with reciting the Nicene Creed, which laid out official doctrine as to this relationship, first in 325AD and then amended in 381AD.\n\nEarly Christianity was plagued by infighting between various parts of the religious spectrum. While the religious arguments were probably genuine in many cases, what really was happening was a fight for authority over the Church. With the loss of the Western Roman Empire in 476AD the center of imperial Christianity firmly moved to the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire in Constantinople. Christianity in the West became heavily influenced by the German dominated tribes who carved up the Western Empire into the dukedoms and kingdoms that would eventually become Spain, France and northern Italy.\n\nThe Church in Rome developed supranational authority thanks to the crowning of the Frankish King Charlemagne by Pope Leo III in 800AD. However, by that stage neither the Church in Rome nor the Church in Constantinople recognised the authority of the other. Relations were so terrible that during the Fourth Crusade, in 1202-1204, Crusaders attacked and sacked Constantinople on their way to Jerusalem. Constantinople never recovered and was already on its knees when the Turks conquered it 250 years later.\n\nMeanwhile, the third monotheistic religion exploded out of the Arabian peninsula in the 630s and 640s. Like Christianity, Islam is a derivative of Judaism. As a result, it shares the same fundamental problem -if there is only one God and you claim to have the most accurate interpretation of God's word and will, everybody who disagrees with your interpretation must be wrong. If those that disagree with you are relatively weak politically and economically, it is probably sufficient to let them worship their incorrect ways without too much harassment: they are not a threat. However, if they are politically, economically and militarily strong, they are a threat.\n\nWhich brings us to the next Christian split, between Protestants and Catholics. Early Protestants were Catholics who simply disagreed with the Church in Rome. Martin Luther initially thought that he was strengthening his Catholic Church by highlighting its deficiencies. Only with the deficiencies fixed could Catholicism regain its rightful place at the center of the spiritual world. Pushed to the extremes by an unrepentant Church worried about loss of indulgence revenues, Martin Luther then triggered a second movement of defiance against Rome. Independence from traditional church control was cemented by introducing first a New and then an Old Testament version of the Bible, in German, in the 1520s.\n\nCatholic Church power had never been fully independent and had a symbiotic relationship with the families and rulers of the lands that surrounded Rome. By the 1520s the Habsburg control of the Church in Rome triggered defections by northern German states. When the Pope refused Henry of England a divorce from his wife Catherine of Aragon, the aunt of the Habsburg Emperor Charles V, another defection was caused, that of England. This was ironic as Henry had been given the title \"Defender of the Faith\" by the previous pope for his vigorous attacks on Protestants.\n\nIn the meantime, the Jews who had started the whole shift to monotheism had been scattered all over North Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Their fate in Muslim lands was mostly tolerable. Islam clearly acknowledges the parallel stories of Islam and Judaism. In Christian lands their existence was a permanent reminder that they did not believe that Christ was the Son of God. If Jews were right then Christianity was wrong. If Christianity was right, then how could Jews really be trusted when they denied the self-evident truth? Jews faced centuries of hostility.\n\nIslam would also fracture, between Sunni and Shi'ite. Their split also revolved around the central question of who had the right version of their religion.\n\nBut ultimately the religious question of who was right or wrong can be condensed down into a question of power. If you have power you can control people. If you can control people you can control tax revenues and expenditures. Polytheism does not have this issue as everybody is right. The fight for power is fought on a different basis.\n\nThe opening up of the world and racial superiority\n\nWhile religious splits in Europe really stem from the 300s AD onwards, race problems are relatively recent. In part racial conflicts are recent because most of the world was cut off from each other until the late 1400s, apart from the occasional bout of confrontation along the Eurasian landmass prior to that. In addition, most of the first successful large empires, such as the Roman, Persian and Mongol Empires, were explicitly multi ethnic, rather than being dominated by one racial or ethnic group.\n\n- The Americas were cut off from the rest of mankind for several thousand years prior to the arrival of Columbus in 1492 in the Caribbean. They were also isolated from each other due to the north south axis of the two continents. The Incas had little, or nothing, to do with the Aztecs although ethnically, they were all from the same group that had crossed the Bering land bridge thousands of years before.\n\nThe Americas were cut off from the rest of mankind for several thousand years prior to the arrival of Columbus in 1492 in the Caribbean.

Europeans knew about blacks but the inaccessibility of the desert kept them out away except for occasional interactions with Europe through Egypt.\n\nAfrica was mainly cut off from the rest of Eurasia due to the vast expanse of desert from the Atlantic, across northern Africa and into the Arabian Peninsula.

Spices and silks did head west during the Roman era and silver headed east. Nomadic tribesmen such as the Huns and the Mongols battered themselves against one or both ends of Eurasia from time to time, bringing destruction, disease and trade.\n\nThe two ends of the Eurasian landmasses did know about each other, vaguely. Spices and silks did head west during the Roman era and silver headed east. Nomadic tribesmen such as the Huns and the Mongols battered themselves against one or both ends of Eurasia from time to time, bringing destruction, disease and trade.\n\nFrom the early 1500s, however, many of these worlds began to be thrown together and modern racism was born.\n\nThe birth of modern racism\n\nIn early 1492, Christian Spain finally defeated the Muslims on the Iberian peninsula after hundreds of years of conflict. Muslims and Jews were given permission to stay and to convert to Christianity, or to go into exile. Most stayed and converted. The Catholic monarchs believed that religious harmony was key and religious groups that did not follow the Catholic Church were a potential destabilising threat to their power.\n\nOver a year later, in March 1493, Christopher Columbus returned from his first voyage across the Atlantic. He had landed in the Caribbean Islands of Hispaniola and Cuba in late 1492, mistakenly thinking that he had arrived in the East Indies, China or Japan. This discovery triggered a series of new expeditions, followed by landings in Mexico and the take over of the Aztec and then Inca Empires by the Spanish.\n\nThese conquests were critical in establishing a sense of white Christian superiority over the \"other\". Eurasian diseases such as small pox helped to wipe out most of the native population, establishing the Europeans' sense of physical superiority. Spanish horses, guns and steel body armour helped to establish the Europeans' sense of military superiority. Despite high levels of illiteracy in Europe, no writing even existed in the Inca empire, helping to establish the Europeans' sense of intellectual superiority. Human sacrifice by the Aztecs helped to reinforce the Europeans' sense of moral and religious superiority.\n\nSo at a stroke, Europeans had established in their minds that they were physically, intellectually, militarily and morally superior to the peoples of the Americas. And they were clearly of a different race. Had Columbus landed where he had wanted to land - China - none of this would have happened. The Chinese shared the same diseases and so would not have succumbed to European ones. The Chinese were militarily the equals, if not superiors, to the Spanish. Literacy levels in China were higher. China had the moral codes of Confucianism and Buddhism, which were moral equals of Christianity.\n\nThere were two reasons why Columbus had failed to get Portuguese support for his trip west to China and Japan. First, the Portuguese were very good navigators already and simply did not believe that it was possible to head west and reach China after a few weeks' sailing. They calculated that the Earth was far larger and that no ship could hold sufficient supplies to get there and back. They were right, of course. Second, the Portuguese explorer Bartolemeu Dias had successfully sailed to the southern tip of Africa in 1488. It was a short hop and a skip from there to reaching the Indian Ocean and beyond - which Vasco da Gama would do in 1497. There was no need for a risky trip west, when going south and then east seemed almost a certain bet.\n\nPortugal had a very good knowledge of the western coast of Africa, first kicked off by Henry the Navigator in the 1420s. Africa was appealing due to its gold - especially that of the empire of Mali. There is a wonderful map drawn in 1375 with the king of Mali, Musa Mansa, depicted as a European style monarch holding a sceptre and orb. There is not a hint of his being depicted as an inferior.\n\nAnd yet the death of millions of native Americans through disease and conflicts, European's desire for the sugar, cocoa, tobacco and coffee produced in American soils, a knowledge of west Africa and the infighting of its people brought about the next huge racial shift in world history - African slaves.\n\nSlavery has existed throughout history. Abraham, the patriarch of Judaism, Christianity and Islam was a slave owner. Noah, he of Ark fame, condemned his grandson and all his descendants to slavery. Muslims in Africa were enormous slave traders, capturing not only black slaves but also European slaves on raiding trips around the Mediterranean and as far north as Iceland.\n\nAlong the west African coast the main slavers included the Oyo and Kong Empires, and kingdoms of Benin, Fouta Djallon, Goura Tooro, Koya, Khasso, Kaabu, Ashanti and Dahomey. Europeans (initially Portuguese traders up until the 1630s when the Dutch challenged the Portuguese for the role of leading slave traders) rarely entered the interior of these countries rather they waited for the slaves to be brought to them to be purchased. Over time Dahomey, Bonny and Benin became so rich on the slave trade that their kings were horrified when slavery was banned in the West as it undermined their entire economies.\n\nBut the sale of one racial group to another racial group to do dangerous, backbreaking, work for profit changed the very nature of slavery. Some 16 million blacks are estimated to have landed in the Americas. An additional 16 million are estimated to have died in captivity in Africa or whilst being transported across the Atlantic. Racial prejudices were established early on. The slaves that the Europeans purchased were huddled together and terrified. By the time they arrived in the Americas, many were thin, sick and stinking, covered in their own faeces. They were cowed, illiterate, had strange religions and could not speak the language of their captors. Forced into working the fields under the hot sun and thoroughly dehumanised they were treated worse than animals. Profits from the exports of their labours were so high that it was cheaper to work slaves to death and buy new ones than it was to lower their productivity. After the end of the slave trade it was assumed that slavery would simply die out. Enterprising slave owners, however, soon turned into slave breeders, and any vestige of humanity was further stripped away from them.\n\nEuropean wealth brought more wealth and inventiveness. This wealth and the enjoyment of tobacco, chocolate, sugar and cotton made it easy to put aside any moral quandary that Europeans had about slavery. Sailing ships and navigation technology allowed Europeans to spread further afield. During French and Indian War, between 1754 and 1763, American Indians predominantly sided with the French, who had few colonists, against the British, whose colonies were expanding further into Indian territory. Once the war ended, Britain agreed that the thirteen American colonies would no longer be allowed to expand westwards, bottling up any expansionist tendencies of the American colonists.\n\nHowever, after Napoleon sold France's Louisiana territories to Jefferson in 1803 nothing stopped the American colonists from heading westwards. They entered lands that had remained stable and had recovered from the initial destruction caused by the spread of Eurasian disease after Columbus 300 years earlier. American Indians were ethnically cleansed throughout the 19th Century and their surviving descendants were put on to reservations where their societies were further eradicated by the introduction of legalised gambling and alcohol.\n\nWith the collapse of Britain's first empire in America, Britain looked east and south. Many former American loyalists migrated to the emerging trading posts in India, the Far East and Australasia. India was a powerhouse of a nation, about the size of Western Europe. When Europeans landed, Indians did not get any new diseases and were militarily of equal-ish status, and they had a long and proud written and cultural history. Decades of infighting, however, had left the sub continent politically weak, which Portuguese, Dutch and then British traders exploited.\n\nThe fact that a country as rich and as populous as India could be taken over by a few thousand British would have helped to confirm Europeans' sense of superiority. With the collapse of China and the imposition of the unequal treaties in the 1840s by European powers on that great nation, white Europeans could sit back and reflect on how a small group of white Christian Europeans had, over a period of 350 years from the discovery of the New World, come to dominate all the other racial and cultural groups on the planet.\n\nThe Chinese Unequal Treaties of the 1840s were arguably the high point of Europe's superiority. In 1853, four American ships steamed into Edo Bay, Japan, demanding that Japan open itself up for trade. Japan modernised its institutions and economy at an amazing pace. In 1904-1905 it was sufficiently modernised to defeat the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War. It swiftly moved on Korea and then onto northern China, setting the stage for the Pacific theatre of the Second World War. In the same way that white Europeans could marvel how they had taken over the world, Japan could marvel how it had taken on a major European power and had won.\n\nConquering Korea and China merely affirmed Japan's greatness. Japan's sense of racial and cultural superiority was firmly established.\n\nFrom the perspective of the rest of the world, the two European civil wars of World War One and Two were incredibly helpful in reversing European power. Europe was devastated by the wars, physically and mentally.\n\nDecolonisation of Africa and India was relatively quick. The Cold War stand off put much of the developing world into a cold freeze, but did allow for places like Korea, China, India and Brazil to develop. The end of the Cold War enabled these regions to rapidly catch up as Westerners invested trillions of dollars into those economies, establishing infrastructure, new factories and new markets\n\nSo, to wrap up, are Europeans fundamentally racist?\n\nFirstly, racial and ethic divisions are relatively new. Throughout most of history people would encounter and be in conflict with people who looked like themselves. Prior to the late 1800s very few Europeans would have been in direct contact with Muslims, with the significant exception of those in south east Europe under the Ottoman Empire, who would have fallen into the oppressed, rather than oppressor category. The sense of \"other\" for most of European history from the 300s to the 1500s would mainly have been due to religious and linguistic reasons, differences which were frequently suppressed due to the fact that imperial families like the Habsburgs ruled over so many different peoples.\n\nSecondly, European racism did emerge, due to a series of fortunate circumstances for Europeans and unfortunate circumstances for everybody else:\n\nColumbus was supposed to have landed in China. Had he done, so the likelihood of Europeans being able to dominate China at that point in time was almost zero.\n\n- Since he did arrive in the Caribbean, the fact that Eurasian diseases (like small pox) were more lethal than American diseases (like syphilis) was really unlucky for the native Americans. Had it been the other way round, Europe and Asia's population (as Asia would have been just as susceptible as Europe) might have seen its population drop by 90%.\n\nSince he did arrive in the Caribbean, the fact that Eurasian diseases (like small pox) were more lethal than American diseases (like syphilis) was really unlucky for the native Americans. Had it been the other way round, Europe and Asia's population (as Asia would have been just as susceptible as Europe) might have seen its population drop by 90%.\n\n- If the Americas had been less fractured with stronger leadership the Aztecs and Incas may have been able to resist the few hundred mounted Spaniards who attacked them. Certainly the local advantage in numbers was massive, whatever guns and steel the Spanish had.\n\nIf the Americas had been less fractured with stronger leadership the Aztecs and Incas may have been able to resist the few hundred mounted Spaniards who attacked them.

New money helped pay for more machinery and eventually the rise of the Industrial Revolution in Britain and then in the rest of Europe and America.\n\nHad the mineral and agricultural wealth of the Americas not been harnessed then the technological advantages that helped Europeans dominate India and China would also not have been possible. New money helped pay for more machinery and eventually the rise of the Industrial Revolution in Britain and then in the rest of Europe and America.\n\nFinally, after the Second World War came the realisation of horror. The appalling ethnic cleansing of the European Jews radically changed Europe's casual attitudes to racial superiority and their attitudes to the \"other\".\n\nEuropean Jews were almost indistinguishable from their fellow countrymen. And yet French, Italians, Dutch, Germans, Danes, Poles, Austrians and others all had handed their fellow citizens over to be murdered by Nazis.\n\nEuropeans have now swung to the opposite end of the racism pendulum and are more open and accepting of \"others\", more so than most other non-European nations. Many Europeans today are terrified of racism and fear being accused of being racist. As a result of this fear they feel that they are not allowed to talk about issues that are legitimate subjects of debate, like immigration and the size of a country's population. They use code words, and make references to the \"environment\" and the \"country being full\".\n\nSo Europeans are racists, even today. But they are paranoid racists, frightened of their past. There is no risk that Europeans will slip back into being exploitative racists, shipping blacks from Africa over to New World colonies they no longer possess, or forcing Chinese to buy opium at gun point.\n\nHowever, being fearful of discussing legitimate issues will lead to resentment and anger.\n\nThat is not good.\n\nWhat Does It Take To Get Europeans To Have A Revolution?",

Find yourself a relaxing place to read.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nPart 1: Riders on the Storm: The Proto-Indo-Europeans and Their Warrior Legacy\n\nThe Proto-Indo-Europeans were a remarkable people whose influence on world history can hardly be overstated. These nomadic pastoralists, who emerged on the Eurasian steppes between 4500 and 2500 BCE, were more than just another prehistoric culture; they were the progenitors of a way of life, a system of values, and a worldview that would shape the course of human civilization for millennia to come.\n\nAt the heart of Proto-Indo-European culture was the warrior ethos, a complex code of honor and shame that prized courage, loyalty, and martial prowess above all else. This ethos was not simply a matter of individual glory-seeking, but rather a fundamental organizing principle of Proto-Indo-European society, one that governed everything from family relations to religious beliefs to political hierarchies.\n\nThe origins of this warrior ethos can be traced back to the harsh realities of life on the steppes, where survival depended on one's ability to defend oneself and one's kin against both human and natural threats. In this unforgiving environment, the Proto-Indo-Europeans honed their skills as horsemen, charioteers, and metalworkers, developing sophisticated technologies and tactics that would give them a decisive edge in battle.\n\nAs the Proto-Indo-Europeans expanded across Europe and Asia, they left a profound genetic, linguistic, and cultural impact on the regions they settled. Recent studies in archaeogenetics have revealed that the Y-chromosome haplogroups associated with Proto-Indo-European males are dramatically overrepresented in the ancient DNA of Europe and Asia, while mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down through the female line, shows greater continuity with pre-Indo-European populations.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story of male-driven conquest and assimilation, in which Proto-Indo-European warriors replaced local male populations through violence and warfare while incorporating local women into their social structures. Striking examples of this process can be seen in the Corded Ware culture of Northern Europe, the Sintashta culture of Central Asia, and the Mycenaean Greeks of the Bronze Age Aegean, all of which show clear genetic and archaeological evidence of Proto-Indo-European warrior dominance.\n\nThe linguistic evidence for Proto-Indo-European expansion is equally compelling. The vast Indo-European language family, with its hundreds of member languages spoken by billions of people across Europe, Asia, and beyond, shares a common set of grammatical features and core vocabulary items that point to a shared ancestral tongue. Many of the key terms associated with Proto-Indo-European culture, from \"horse\" and \"wheel\" to \"guest\" and \"host,\" have clear cognates across the Indo-European world, reflecting the common cultural and technological heritage of the Proto-Indo-European peoples.\n\nProto-Indo-European society was characterized by a tripartite division into priests, warriors, and farmers/herders, with the warrior class occupying a place of special privilege and prestige. This tripartite structure, which would persist in various forms among many Indo-European descendant cultures, reflected a cosmic order in which each social group had its own sacred duties and functions.\n\nAt the apex of this order was the figure of the divine warrior, the mythic hero who embodied the virtues of the warrior class and served as a bridge between the human and divine realms. In Proto-Indo-European mythology, this figure took many forms, from the thunder-god Perkwunos to the dragon-slaying hero Trito, but always represented the ideal of the noble warrior who fought for glory, honor, and the protection of his people.\n\nAnother key institution of Proto-Indo-European society was the warrior band or mannerbund, a group of young unmarried men who lived apart from the rest of the community and devoted themselves to hunting, raiding, and martial training. These bands served as a rite of passage for aspiring warriors, a way to prove their mettle and earn their place among the ranks of the adult men. The bonds forged within these warrior bands were among the strongest and most sacred in Proto-Indo-European society, often superseding even familial ties.\n\nProto-Indo-European religion was characterized by a polytheistic pantheon of gods and goddesses, each with their own domains and attributes. At the head of this pantheon was the sky-father *Dyeus, the supreme ruler and upholder of cosmic order, along with a range of other deities associated with natural phenomena, social functions, and moral qualities. This polytheistic worldview proved remarkably adaptable as the Proto-Indo-Europeans spread across Eurasia, allowing them to incorporate local deities and cults into their own religious framework.\n\nWhile the Proto-Indo-European warrior ethos had many positive aspects, such as its emphasis on courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice, it also had a darker side that is reflected in the mythologies of the Indo-European peoples. One of the most disturbing themes in these mythologies is the prevalence of rape and sexual violence, particularly in stories involving gods and heroes.\n\nIn the Greek and Roman pantheons, for example, male deities like Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo are frequently depicted as using their power and status to force themselves upon mortal women and even goddesses. These stories, which often involve deception, coercion, and outright violence, reflect the deeply patriarchal nature of ancient Indo-European societies, where women were seen as little more than property to be traded, conquered, and possessed.\n\nThe roots of these attitudes may go back to the Proto-Indo-European culture of conquest and domination, in which warriors would often massacre the men of conquered populations and take the women as wives and concubines. While these myths do not represent the totality of Proto-Indo-European culture, they serve as a stark reminder of the ways in which the warrior ethos could be used to justify the subjugation and exploitation of women.\n\nThe impact of the Proto-Indo-European warrior ethos on Western civilization can hardly be overstated. From the conquests of the Hittites and Mycenaeans to the empire-building of the Romans and British, the values and ideals of the Proto-Indo-European warrior class have shaped the course of human events in profound and enduring ways.\n\nIn the classical world of Greece and Rome, the Proto-Indo-European warrior ethos underwent a significant synthesis with the intellectual and artistic traditions of the Near East, giving rise to new ideals of heroism, virtue, and excellence. The figure of the warrior-hero, embodied in legends like Achilles, Hercules, and Aeneas, became the central archetype of classical literature and art, and would go on to inspire countless generations of soldiers, statesmen, and adventurers.\n\nAmong the Celtic and Germanic peoples of ancient and early medieval Europe, the Proto-Indo-European warrior ethos took on new forms and expressions, shaped by the unique social and environmental conditions of the north. The institution of the comitatus, the war-band of noble warriors sworn to defend their lord to the death, became the backbone of Germanic society, while the love of glory and reckless individualism of the Celtic warrior class made them both admired and feared by their enemies.\n\nAs descendants of the Proto-Indo-Europeans, the Romans inherited many of the same values and ideals that had animated their ancestors on the steppes. The Roman concept of virtus, which encompassed such qualities as courage, manliness, and martial prowess, can be seen as a direct continuation of the Proto-Indo-European warrior ethos.\n\nLike their Proto-Indo-European forebears, the Romans placed a high value on courage, discipline, and the willingness to sacrifice one's life for the greater good of the community. The ideal Roman man was a soldier and a citizen, someone who was always ready to take up arms in defense of the state and its values.\n\nAt the same time, the Romans also developed their own distinctive ethos that set them apart from other ancient civilizations. This ethos was centered around the pursuit of glory and the idea of Rome as a divinely ordained empire, destined to rule the world.\n\nFor the Romans, the highest aspiration was to achieve immortality through great deeds and to be remembered by posterity for one's valour, wisdom, and service to the state. This desire for glory fueled Rome's relentless expansion, as generations of Roman soldiers and statesmen sought to extend the empire's borders and bring new peoples under its sway.\n\nAlongside this emphasis on conquest and glory, the Romans also placed a high value on civic virtue and the idea of the common good. Roman society was highly stratified, with a rigid hierarchy that distinguished between patricians, plebeians, and slaves, but all citizens were expected to subordinate their individual interests to the greater good of the republic.\n\nIn the religious sphere, the Romans were polytheists who worshipped a vast pantheon of gods and goddesses, many of whom had their roots in the Proto-Indo-European past. Like their ancestors, the Romans saw their deities as powerful but capricious beings who needed to be propitiated with sacrifices and offerings.\n\nRoman religion was also closely intertwined with politics and the state, with public rituals and festivals serving to unite the community and reaffirm the authority of the ruling elite. The pax deorum, or \"peace of the gods,\" was seen as essential to the stability and prosperity of the empire, and great care was taken to maintain this delicate balance through proper observance of religious rites.\n\nThe values and worldview of the Roman Empire, with its emphasis on martial prowess, civic virtue, and the pursuit of glory, can be seen as a direct continuation of the warrior ethos of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The Romans inherited and adapted this ethos, creating a civilization that would come to dominate the Mediterranean world and leave an indelible mark on Western culture.\n\nHowever, as we will see in the next part, the rise of Judaism would introduce a radically different set of values and beliefs, centered around the idea of a single, all-powerful God who demanded moral righteousness and social justice from his followers. The encounter between these two worldviews - the pagan warrior ethos of the Romans and the monotheism of the Jews - would set the stage for a profound transformation in Western civilization.\n\nPart 2: Chosen and Tested: The Ancient Israelites and the Forging of Monotheism\n\nUnlike the Proto-Indo-Europeans, who were an expansionist and assimilationist culture that spread their language, religion, and way of life through conquest and migration, the Jews were a people who sought to maintain their distinct identity in the face of conquest and oppression. Their commitment to cultural and religious purity, rooted in their monotheistic faith and their belief in their unique covenant with God, would have far-reaching consequences for their history and their interactions with the wider world.\n\nThe story of the Jewish people begins with the figure of Abraham, a nomadic herder from the city of Ur in ancient Mesopotamia. According to the biblical account, God called Abraham to leave his homeland and journey to the land of Canaan, where he would become the father of a great nation.\n\nThis divine call, known as the Abrahamic covenant, is the foundational event of Jewish history. In exchange for Abraham's faith and obedience, God promised to make him the ancestor of a multitude of nations, to give his descendants the land of Canaan as an eternal inheritance, and to bless all the peoples of the earth through his offspring.\n\nOne of the most important revelations of the Abrahamic covenant was the concept of monotheism, the belief in a single, all-powerful God who created the universe and governs it according to his will. This belief, which set the Jews apart from the polytheistic cultures of the ancient Near East and the Proto-Indo-European world, would become the cornerstone of Jewish religion and identity. Unlike the specialized deities of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, each with their own domains and attributes, the Jewish God was understood as the one true God, the source of all creation and the ultimate moral authority.\n\nAnother key element of the Abrahamic covenant was the practice of circumcision, which God commanded as a sign of the covenant between himself and Abraham's descendants. This practice would become a defining marker of Jewish identity, setting the Jews apart from their uncircumcised neighbours and symbolizing their unique relationship with God.\n\nThe story of Abraham and his descendants, recounted in the biblical book of Genesis, is a complex tapestry of triumphs and tragedies, reflecting the recurring themes of Jewish history. It includes the sibling rivalry between Jacob and Esau, which foreshadows the later conflicts between the Israelites and their neighbours, and the story of Joseph, whose journey from slavery to power in Egypt anticipates the Exodus narrative and the Jewish people's own experience of exile and redemption.\n\nThe central event of Jewish history is undoubtedly the Exodus, the story of God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and his covenant with them at Mount Sinai. This defining moment, commemorated annually in the Passover Seder, represents the birth of the Jewish nation and the foundation of their unique relationship with God.\n\nThe Exodus story, recounted in the biblical book of the same name, begins with the Israelites' enslavement under a harsh Egyptian pharaoh. But God raises up a deliverer in Moses, a Hebrew raised in the Egyptian court, who confronts Pharaoh and demands the release of his people. After a dramatic series of plagues and miracles, culminating in the parting of the Red Sea, the Israelites escape from Egypt and journey to Mount Sinai, where God reveals himself to them and establishes his covenant.\n\nThis covenant, known as the Mosaic covenant, is centered on the giving of the Torah, the divine law that would govern every aspect of Israelite life. The Torah, which includes the Ten Commandments and a host of other ethical and ritual provisions, represents a radical departure from the laws and customs of the surrounding nations. It is a blueprint for a society based on justice, compassion, and holiness, reflecting the character of the one true God who delivered the Israelites from bondage.\n\nThe impact of the Exodus and the Mosaic covenant on Jewish identity cannot be overstated. They represent the defining moment when the Israelites became a nation, bound together by their shared history and their covenant with God. The story of the Exodus, retold annually at Passover, becomes a paradigm for God's ongoing redemption of his people from oppression, a theme that will resonate through centuries of Jewish history.\n\nAfter receiving the Torah at Sinai, the Israelites journey to the promised land of Canaan, where they must confront the challenge of conquest and settlement. The biblical book of Joshua portrays this as a swift and decisive victory, but archaeological evidence suggests a more gradual and complex process, with the Israelites coexisting and intermingling with the Canaanites for generations.\n\nThe period following the conquest is known as the time of the judges, when charismatic leaders like Deborah and Samson lead the Israelites in battle against their enemies. But it is also a time of political and religious instability, as the Israelites struggle to maintain their loyalty to God in the face of the temptations of Canaanite culture and religion.\n\nThis tension between faithfulness to God's covenant and assimilation into the surrounding cultures will be a recurring theme throughout Jewish history. It reflects the challenge of maintaining a distinct religious and cultural identity in the face of conquest, exile, and foreign domination - a challenge that the Jews will face time and again, from the Babylonian exile to the Hellenistic period to the Roman occupation.\n\nThe period of the judges gives way to the rise of the Israelite monarchy, beginning with the reign of Saul and reaching its apex under David and Solomon. David, the great warrior-king and psalmist, unites the tribes of Israel and establishes Jerusalem as the capital and spiritual center of the kingdom. His son Solomon builds the first Temple, a permanent dwelling place for God's presence among his people.\n\nBut the monarchy also brings new challenges and temptations. Solomon's reign, for all its wisdom and prosperity, is marked by religious and moral decline, as foreign alliances and idolatry lead the nation away from God. After Solomon's death, the kingdom divides into two rival states, Israel and Judah, each with its own complex history of faithfulness and apostasy.\n\nIn 722 BCE, the northern kingdom of Israel falls to the Assyrians, and its people are deported and dispersed among the nations. The southern kingdom of Judah endures for over a century, but it too meets a similar fate at the hands of the Babylonians in 586 BCE. The Temple is destroyed, the monarchy ends, and the Jewish people enter a new phase of their history - the long and bitter exile in Babylon.\n\nThe Babylonian exile marks a watershed moment in Jewish history, as the people grapple with the trauma of defeat, the loss of the Temple, and the challenge of maintaining their identity in a foreign land. But it is also a time of remarkable spiritual and cultural renewal, as prophets like Ezekiel and Jeremiah call the people to repentance and new forms of religious life emerge to sustain the community in exile.\n\nOne of the most significant developments of this period is the rise of the synagogue as a center of worship and Torah study. With the Temple destroyed and the sacrificial cult suspended, the synagogue becomes the focal point of Jewish religious life, a development that will have far-reaching consequences for the future of Judaism.\n\nThe exile also sees the emergence of a new form of Judaism, centered on the study and interpretation of the Torah. This early form of Rabbinic Judaism, which will reach its fullest expression in the centuries following the destruction of the Second Temple, represents a shift away from the Temple-based, priestly religion of ancient Israel to a more portable and adaptable form of religious life, one that can sustain the Jewish people through centuries of dispersion and persecution.\n\nThe return of the exiles to Jerusalem under Persian rule sets the stage for a new chapter in Jewish history - the Second Temple period. The rebuilt Temple becomes the center of a revitalized Jewish community, but one that faces new challenges and opportunities in the cultural and political ferment of the Hellenistic world.\n\nThe most dramatic of these challenges comes in the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV, who seeks to suppress Jewish religion and impose Hellenistic culture on the Jews. In 167 BCE, a Jewish revolt led by the Maccabees successfully overthrows the Seleucids and establishes an independent Jewish state, known as the Hasmonean dynasty.\n\nBut the Hasmonean state is plagued by internal conflicts and external threats, and it eventually falls to the Romans in 63 BCE. The Roman period is a time of great unrest and ferment in Jewish society, with the emergence of new religious and political movements that seek to challenge the status quo and assert competing visions of Jewish identity and destiny.\n\nIt is in this context that Christianity emerges as a messianic movement within Judaism, centered around the figure of Jesus of Nazareth. Both Jesus and his early followers are deeply rooted in Jewish scripture and tradition, but they also claim to be the bearers of a new revelation - one that will transcend the boundaries of Jewish identity and offer salvation to all who believe.\n\nIn the next part of this article, we will explore the origins and early history of Christianity, and how it both emerges from and challenges the Jewish world that gave birth to it. We will see how the complex cultural and religious forces that shaped Judaism - from the monotheism of Abraham to the Torah of Moses to the messianic ferment of the Second Temple period - also shape the development of early Christianity, and set the stage for the encounter between these two great traditions and the warrior ethos of the Greco-Roman world.\n\nPart 3: The Sword and the Cross: Christianity's Struggle to Tame the Warrior Ethos\n\nIn this part, we will examine how these two worldviews came into contact and conflict in the first centuries of the Common Era, giving rise to two new religious movements: early Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. We will explore how these movements emerged from the diverse world of Second Temple Judaism and grappled with the challenges posed by Roman rule, Hellenistic culture, and the Jewish scriptural tradition.\n\nTo understand the rise of early Christianity, we must first situate Jesus within the Jewish world of his time. This was a world shaped by the complex interplay of religious, cultural, and political forces, from the legacy of the Maccabean revolt to the tensions of Roman occupation.\n\nAt the center of Jewish life was the Temple in Jerusalem, rebuilt by Herod the Great in the late first century BCE. The Temple served as both the locus of Jewish worship and sacrifice and a potent symbol of Jewish identity and national aspirations. It was here that the Sadducees, the priestly elite, held sway, and where Jews from across the diaspora gathered for the major festivals.\n\nBut the Temple was also a flashpoint for conflict, as different Jewish factions vied for control over its administration and meaning. The Pharisees, a lay movement focused on the study and observance of the Torah, clashed with the Sadducees over matters of belief and practice. The Essenes, a separatist sect, rejected the Temple cult entirely, looking instead to an apocalyptic battle between good and evil.\n\nInto this fractured world came Jesus of Nazareth, a young Jewish man from Galilee. The Gospels present Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah, conceived by the Holy Spirit and destined to bring salvation to Israel and the world. As he began his public ministry, Jesus attracted followers with his teachings and miracles, which were seen as signs of his divine authority. He preached a message of repentance and renewal, calling his fellow Jews to turn back to God and follow his will.\n\nAt the heart of Jesus' message was a radical reinterpretation of the Jewish scriptures and tradition. Jesus saw himself as the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies, the one who would usher in the reign of God on earth. But he also challenged many traditional Jewish beliefs and practices, offering a new vision of what it meant to be faithful to God.\n\nCentral to Jesus' teaching was an ethic of love and compassion, captured in his command to love God with all one's being and to love one's neighbor as oneself. Jesus emphasised forgiveness over retribution, urging his followers to forgive their enemies and reconcile with those who wronged them. This ethos of love and forgiveness stood in sharp contrast to the warrior values of the Greco-Roman world, with its focus on honor, glory, and vengeance.\n\nJesus' teachings also subverted the rigid social hierarchies and purity codes of Jewish society. He reached out to the marginalized and the outcast - women, Samaritans, Gentiles, tax collectors, and sinners - proclaiming God's love and acceptance for all, regardless of social status or moral standing. He critiqued the hypocrisy and legalism of the religious establishment, emphasizing the primacy of mercy and justice over ritual observance.\n\nAt the same time, Jesus called his followers to a life of righteousness and obedience to God's will. He warned against the dangers of sin and hypocrisy, urging his disciples to seek first the kingdom of God and to practice humility, self-denial, and sacrificial love. In this sense, Jesus stood firmly within the Jewish prophetic tradition, even as he challenged many conventional assumptions about what it meant to be a faithful Jew.\n\nDespite his message of love and peace, Jesus faced mounting opposition from the Jewish religious authorities and the Roman occupiers, who saw him as a threat to the established order. Eventually, he was arrested, tried, and executed by crucifixion - a brutal form of punishment reserved for the worst criminals and political subversives.\n\nFor Jesus' followers, his death dealt a devastating blow to their messianic hopes and expectations. But the Gospel accounts report that three days after his crucifixion, Jesus rose from the dead, appearing to his disciples and commissioning them to spread his message of salvation to the ends of the earth.\n\nThe resurrection became the defining event of Christian faith, the ultimate vindication of Jesus' identity and mission. It transformed a small band of demoralized disciples into a dynamic and rapidly growing movement, convinced that Jesus was the Messiah and the Son of God.\n\nBut the idea of a suffering and dying Messiah, one who would be raised from the dead and offer salvation to all people, represented a radical departure from traditional Jewish messianic expectations. For most Jews of the time, the Messiah was conceived as a military and political leader who would overthrow the Romans and restore Israel's kingdom. The Christian claim that Jesus was the Messiah thus posed a profound challenge to Jewish identity and self-understanding.\n\nThe early Christian movement that emerged in the wake of Jesus' death and resurrection was initially a small sect within the Jewish world. Its members were mostly Jewish followers of Jesus who continued to observe Jewish law and worship in the Temple and synagogues, even as they proclaimed Jesus as the Messiah.\n\nBut as the movement spread beyond Palestine and began to attract Gentile converts, it started to develop a distinct identity and way of life. These Gentile Christians, who were not bound by Jewish law and custom, raised new questions about the relationship between Judaism and Christianity and challenged the Jewish character of the early church.\n\nA key figure in this development was Paul, a Jewish Pharisee who had once persecuted the followers of Jesus but underwent a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus. As a missionary and theologian, Paul traveled the Mediterranean world, establishing Christian communities and articulating a vision of Christian identity that emphasized faith in Christ over observance of the Jewish law.\n\nPaul's theology stressed the universality of Christ's salvation and the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God apart from adherence to Jewish law. This message of universalism represented a radical break from the particularism and exclusivism of Jewish identity, and it helped fuel the rapid spread of Christianity across the Roman Empire.\n\nAt the same time, Paul's teachings brought the early Christian movement into tension with Jewish tradition and belief, raising questions about the ongoing relationship between the two faiths. This tension would only deepen as Christianity continued to develop and define itself over against Judaism in the centuries to come.\n\nEven as Christianity was emerging as a distinct religious movement, the Jewish world was undergoing its own transformation in the aftermath of the Roman destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. With the loss of the Temple and the end of the sacrificial cult, Judaism was forced to reinvent itself as a religion centered on the study and interpretation of the Torah. It is likely that many Jews left their homeland at this time. What is also likely is that as they left many would have proselytised and converted gentiles into a new form of Judaism, in a similar way that Christianity and later Islam would convert other polytheistic believers to monotheism.\n\nThis form of Judaism, known as Rabbinic Judaism, was led by the rabbis - religious scholars and teachers who saw themselves as the heirs of the Pharisaic tradition. The rabbis developed an extensive body of oral law and commentary - eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud - to guide Jewish life and practice in the absence of the Temple.\n\nRabbinic Judaism emphasized the importance of Torah study, prayer, and the performance of the commandments (mitzvot) as the central practices of Jewish life. It also cultivated a strong sense of communal identity and solidarity, with the synagogue serving as the focus of Jewish social and religious life.\n\nLike early Christianity, Rabbinic Judaism had to grapple with the challenge of maintaining Jewish identity and tradition in a world dominated by Hellenistic culture and Roman power. The rabbis sought to balance the demands of Jewish law and custom with the realities of life in the diaspora, engaging selectively with Greco-Roman culture while preserving a distinct Jewish way of life.\n\nThe emergence of early Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism in the first centuries CE represents a decisive moment in the history of Western religion and culture. Both movements grew out of the complex world of Second Temple Judaism, but developed in response to the challenges of Roman rule and Hellenistic influence.\n\nChristianity, with its message of universal salvation and its emphasis on faith over works of the law, posed a direct challenge to Jewish identity and tradition. It rejected the particularism of the Jewish covenant in favor of a new vision of a inclusive community of believers, united by their faith in Christ.\n\nRabbinic Judaism, in contrast, sought to preserve Jewish identity and way of life in the face of Roman persecution and the loss of the Temple. It did so by recentering Jewish religious life around the study of the Torah and the observance of the commandments, creating a portable and resilient form of Judaism that could survive in diaspora.\n\nPart 4: Empires of Faith: The Christianization of Rome and Europe\n\nIn this part, we will trace the rise of Christianity within the context of the Roman Empire, examining how the early Christian community navigated the challenges and opportunities posed by its relationship with the Roman state. We will see how the persecution of Christians shaped the development of Christian theology and identity, and how the conversion of Emperor Constantine marked a turning point in the history of the church and the empire.\n\nMoreover, we will explore the complex process of the Christianization of the Roman world, and how this process involved a gradual negotiation and transformation of both Christian values and the cultural heritage of the Greco-Roman world. We will see how Christian thinkers sought to synthesize classical and Christian thought, but also how the church began to absorb and adapt elements of the warrior ethos as it became increasingly intertwined with Roman power structures.\n\nThe early Christian movement, emerging from within Second Temple Judaism, quickly spread beyond its Jewish roots and attracted converts from throughout the Roman Empire. This process of expansion brought the early Christians into contact and conflict with the Roman state, which viewed the new movement with suspicion and hostility.\n\nAt the heart of this conflict was the Roman concept of religio, which emphasized the proper observance of traditional rites and ceremonies as a matter of public order and social stability, closely tied to the authority of the state and the emperor. The early Christians, however, rejected this view and instead prioritized individual faith and the authority of God over all earthly powers, refusing to participate in the imperial cult and proclaiming their allegiance to a higher power.\n\nThis refusal to conform to the religious norms of the Roman state brought the early Christians into conflict with the authorities, who saw the movement as a threat to social order and political stability. Despite this hostility, the early Christian community continued to grow and spread, attracted by the message of salvation and the promise of eternal life, meeting in secret and developing their own distinctive rituals and practices.\n\nThe Roman state responded to the early Christian movement with a series of persecutions that would shape the development of Christian theology and identity in profound ways. From the first major persecution under Emperor Nero in the mid-first century CE to the systematic campaign of Emperor Diocletian in the early fourth century, Christians faced torture, execution, and social ostracism for their refusal to conform to the religious norms of the empire.\n\nDespite the brutality of these persecutions, the early Christian community remained committed to the peaceful teachings of Jesus, emphasizing the values of love, forgiveness, and non-violence in the face of oppression. The stories of the martyrs, who willingly suffered and died for their faith, became a powerful source of inspiration and comfort for the early church, shaping a new understanding of spiritual warfare that saw the struggle between the church and the Roman state as a cosmic battle between good and evil.\n\nThe persecution of Christians came to an end in the early fourth century with the conversion of Emperor Constantine, who, according to tradition, had a vision of a cross before a decisive battle with the words \"In this sign, conquer.\" Constantine's conversion marked a turning point in the history of the church and the empire, as Christianity went from being a persecuted minority to the favored religion of the Roman state.\n\nOver the next several decades, Constantine and his successors took steps to support and promote Christianity, building churches, sponsoring Christian art and literature, and convening councils to settle theological disputes. The church began to align its structures with those of the imperial government, with bishops taking on roles as civil officials and the boundaries between religious and political authority becoming increasingly blurred.\n\nThis alignment of church and state had profound consequences for the development of Christianity and its relationship to the warrior ethos of the Greco-Roman world. As Christianity became more closely intertwined with the power structures of the empire, it began to absorb and adapt elements of the dominant culture, including the martial values of courage, strength, and conquest.\n\nThis process can be seen in the emergence of the cult of the saints, which often emphasized the martial virtues and portrayed saints as spiritual warriors, and in the growing use of military metaphors and imagery in Christian discourse. While some Christian thinkers, like Tertullian and Jerome, rejected the classical tradition as a source of corruption, others, like Eusebius and Lactantius, sought to present Christianity as the fulfillment of classical philosophy and culture.\n\nThe rise of monasticism in the fourth and fifth centuries can be seen as an attempt to recapture the peaceful essence of Jesus' teachings and to resist the temptations of worldly power and influence. Monastic communities, which emphasized asceticism, prayer, and withdrawal from secular affairs, served as a reminder of the countercultural origins of Christianity and its call to a life of simplicity and devotion. However, even these communities would eventually become enmeshed in the power structures of medieval Christendom, with monasteries serving as centers of learning, economic production, and political influence.\n\nAs Christianity became increasingly aligned with the structures of Roman power, its relationship with Rabbinic Judaism, which had emerged as a distinct tradition in the aftermath of the destruction of the Second Temple, became more complex and fraught.\n\nOn the one hand, Christianity continued to see itself as the fulfillment of the promises made to Israel in the Old Testament, and many early Christian writers, such as Justin Martyr and Origen, sought to engage in dialogue with Jewish scholars and argue for the truth of Christianity on the basis of Jewish scripture and tradition. On the other hand, the Christianization of the empire also led to a growing sense of triumphalism among Christians, who increasingly saw Judaism as a defunct religion that had been superseded by the new covenant of Christ.\n\nThis attitude is reflected in the anti-Jewish homilies of figures like John Chrysostom, who accused the Jews of deicide and called for their exclusion from Christian society. As Christianity became more closely aligned with the warrior ethos of the Greco-Roman world, it also began to adopt a more aggressive stance towards other religions, including Judaism, as exemplified by the launch of the Crusades in the late eleventh century.\n\nDespite these tensions and conflicts, Rabbinic Judaism continued to thrive and develop in the centuries following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, with the Talmud becoming the foundation of Jewish religious and legal tradition. The rise of Islam in the seventh century also had a significant impact on the relationship between Christianity and Judaism, creating new opportunities for Jewish communities under Muslim rule and fostering a culture of intellectual exchange between scholars of all three faiths.\n\nDespite the efforts of Christian thinkers to reinterpret and transform the classical tradition, the warrior ethos of the Greco-Roman world continued to exert a powerful influence on Western culture throughout the medieval and early modern periods, as seen in the chivalric ideal of the knight, the crusading spirit, and the rise of the nation-state.\n\nAt the same time, the Christian tradition also continued to offer a powerful critique of the warrior ethos, with figures like Erasmus and Thomas More promoting a vision of society based on the peaceful principles of the Gospel, and mystics like Francis of Assisi and Teresa of Avila emphasizing the importance of humility, compassion, and inner transformation.\n\nThis tension between the warrior ethos and the values of the Gospel would remain a recurring theme throughout the history of the West, shaping the development of art, literature, and politics, and giving rise to new religious and intellectual movements that sought to challenge the authority of tradition and promote alternative ways of understanding the world and the human condition.\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire marked a pivotal moment in the history of the West, as the church sought to transform the culture and society of the ancient world in the light of the Gospel. This process involved a complex negotiation between the peaceful teachings of Jesus and the martial values of the Greco-Roman world, as well as an ongoing struggle to reinterpret and redefine the relationship between religious and political authority.\n\nPart 5: Heaven and Earth Collide: The Reformation, Enlightenment, and the Fracturing of Christendom\n\nIn this part, we will explore how this tension came to a head in the early modern period, as the fragmentation of Christendom and the rise of competing ideologies challenged the unity and authority of the Christian church. We will see how the Protestant Reformation and the wars of religion shattered the medieval synthesis of faith and reason, church and state, and how the rise of the nation-state and the Enlightenment paved the way for the emergence of secular ideologies that would shape the course of the 20th century.\n\nThroughout this tumultuous period, we will also trace the continued evolution of the warrior ethos, from its taming and channeling by the medieval church to its resurgence in a secularized form with the rise of nationalism and the nation-state. And we will explore the survival and adaptation of Rabbinic Judaism in the face of persecution and marginalization, and how the Jewish experience of diaspora and minority status would inform Jewish responses to the challenges of modernity.\n\nAs we saw in Part 4, the Christianization of the Roman Empire was a complex and contested process, as the church sought to adapt itself to the realities of Roman power while also transforming Roman society in the light of the Gospel. One of the key tensions in this process was between the monotheistic exclusivism of Christianity, with its insistence on the unique truth of Christ, and the polytheistic inclusivism of the Greco-Roman world, with its openness to incorporating new gods and cults into its pantheon.\n\nThis tension manifested itself in various ways throughout the early and medieval periods of Christianity. On the one hand, the church insisted on the absolute and exclusive nature of its truth claims, rejecting the worship of pagan gods and the toleration of heresy. On the other hand, it also accommodated itself to the assimilationist tendencies of the Greco-Roman world, as seen in the cult of the saints, which can be understood as a Christianized form of polytheism, with different saints serving as patrons and intercessors for different aspects of life.\n\nThis tension between monotheistic purity and pseudo-polytheistic accommodation would continue to simmer within Christianity throughout the medieval period, even as the church established itself as the dominant institution in the Western world. It would come to a boil in the early modern period, with the Protestant Reformation and the wars of religion that followed.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation, which began with Martin Luther's challenge to the authority and teachings of the Catholic Church in 1517, represented a reassertion of monotheistic exclusivism against the perceived corruptions and accommodations of medieval Christianity. Luther and other reformers, such as John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli, insisted on the absolute authority of scripture and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, rejecting the cult of the saints, the sale of indulgences, and other practices that they saw as compromising the purity of the Gospel.\n\nThe Reformation shattered the unity of Western Christendom, as different regions and rulers aligned themselves with either the Catholic or Protestant cause. The result was a series of devastating wars of religion, such as the French Wars of Religion and the Thirty Years' War, which tore Europe apart in the 16th and 17th centuries. These wars were marked by brutal acts of sectarian violence, as Catholics and Protestants sought to impose their version of the true faith on each other through force of arms. Millions of people were killed during these wars as differing versions of monotheism used the power of the state to kill rival Christian doctrines. Governments tortured and burned at the stake thousands of its own citizens in an attempt to terrorise people into remaining into the official state religion.\n\nThe fragmentation of Christendom also had important implications for the relationship between church and state, as the principle of cuius regio, eius religio (\"whose realm, his religion\") gave rulers the right to determine the official religion of their territories. This paved the way for the rise of the modern nation-state, as rulers sought to assert their sovereignty over both temporal and spiritual affairs.\n\nThe wars of religion and the rise of the nation-state also set the stage for the emergence of secular ideologies in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, tolerance, and individual rights, represented a challenge to the authority of both church and state, and a revival of the Proto-Indo-European spirit of openness and curiosity about other cultures and traditions.\n\nEnlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire, Diderot, and Hume sought to understand religion as a human phenomenon, subject to historical and cultural variation, rather than as a divine revelation. They were fascinated by the diversity of religious beliefs and practices around the world, and sought to develop a comparative approach to the study of religion that would later inform the rise of modern anthropology and sociology.\n\nAt the same time, the Enlightenment also gave rise to new forms of political ideology, such as liberalism, nationalism, and socialism, which sought to redefine the relationship between the individual and the state, and to establish new bases for social and political order. These ideologies would shape the course of European and world history in the 19th and 20th centuries, as nations and empires clashed over competing visions of modernity and progress.\n\nThroughout this period of fragmentation and upheaval, the warrior ethos of the Proto-Indo-Europeans continued to evolve and adapt to new cultural and political contexts. In the Germanic kingdoms that emerged after the fall of Rome, the warrior ethos was channeled into the institution of feudalism, with its complex web of loyalties and obligations between lords and vassals.\n\nThe Crusades represented a further transformation of the warrior ethos, as the church sought to harness the martial energies of the European nobility in the service of the faith. The ideal of the Christian knight, fighting for God and the defense of the Holy Land, would shape European culture and identity for centuries to come.\n\nWith the rise of the nation-state and the wars of religion, however, the warrior ethos began to take on a more secularized form, as loyalty to one's king or country became more important than loyalty to the church or to abstract ideals of chivalry. The French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars marked a turning point in this process, as mass armies of citizen-soldiers fought for the glory of the nation rather than for the honor of the aristocracy.\n\nThis nationalization of the warrior ethos would reach its apogee in the 20th century, with the rise of totalitarian ideologies such as fascism and National Socialism, which sought to mobilize entire societies for war and conquest in the name of racial or national supremacy. The horrors of two world wars would finally discredit these ideologies, but the warrior ethos would continue to shape global politics throughout the Cold War and beyond, as nations and non-state actors continued to resort to violence and terrorism to achieve their goals.\n\nThroughout all these upheavals, Rabbinic Judaism continued to survive and adapt to the challenges of life in the diaspora. Despite facing persecution, forced conversions, and expulsions at the hands of Christian and Muslim rulers, Jewish communities managed to preserve their distinct identity and way of life, centered on the study of the Torah and the observance of the commandments.\n\nThe emancipation of European Jews in the 18th and 19th centuries posed new challenges and opportunities for Jewish identity and culture. As Jews began to integrate into modern society and participate in secular education and culture, they grappled with the tension between their particular religious and ethnic identity and the universal values of the Enlightenment.\n\nThis tension would give rise to a variety of Jewish responses to modernity, from the ultra-Orthodoxy of the Hasidim to the Reform movement's efforts to adapt Judaism to modern life, and from the Zionist dream of a Jewish homeland to the cosmopolitan ideal of a Jewish contribution to global culture. These responses would shape Jewish life and thought well into the 20th century, as Jews faced the unprecedented challenges of the Holocaust and the creation of the State of Israel.\n\nPart 6: Requiem for Christendom: World Wars, Genocide, and the Death of God\n\nThe 20th century was a time of immense upheaval and transformation for Western civilization, as the traditional cultural and religious frameworks that had shaped European society for centuries began to unravel in the face of new ideologies, political movements, and social changes. The staggering loss of life in the two World Wars, particularly the loss of millions of young men, had far-reaching consequences that extended beyond the battlefield, contributing to the rise of feminism and other secular ideologies that would profoundly shape the post-war era.\n\nThe trauma and devastation of World War I had a profound impact on European society, shaking the foundations of traditional beliefs and institutions. The immense loss of life, the brutality of trench warfare, and the apparent senselessness of the conflict led many Europeans to question the relevance and authority of Christianity and other long-standing ideologies.\n\nIn this context, new secular ideologies emerged as powerful alternatives, offering visions of a world transformed by human action and political will. Communism, with its call for a classless society and the abolition of private property, gained adherents among workers and intellectuals who saw in it a path to social justice and equality. Socialism, in its various forms, advocated for the redistribution of wealth and the empowerment of the working class through democratic means.\n\nNationalism, which had been a driving force behind the war, took on new forms and intensities in the post-war period. In some cases, such as in Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany, nationalism was fused with elements of socialism and the glorification of the state, giving rise to fascist and National Socialist ideologies that would have significant consequences for Europe and the world.\n\nFeminism also challenged traditional gender roles and patriarchal power structures. At its core, feminism represented a fundamental rebuke of the masculine honor-shame ethos that had permeated Proto-Indo-European warrior cultures. Where the warrior ideal glorified martial valor, female subjugation, and male dominance, feminist thinkers demanded equality, autonomy, and a re-evaluation of gender norms. The campaigns for women's suffrage, reproductive rights, and entry into male-dominated spheres like politics and the workplace struck at the very heart of the centuries-old patriarchal order. As Europeans redefined their values around gender equality, they found themselves disconnected from a core aspect of their cultural heritage.\n\nThe rise of fascism in Italy and National Socialism in Germany represented a deliberate attempt to revive and harness the Proto-Indo-European warrior ethos, with its emphasis on honor, glory, and racial identity. Benito Mussolini, the founder of Italian Fascism, sought to present himself as a new Roman emperor, leading Italy to greatness through military conquest and the expansion of Italian influence.\n\nMussolini's regime made extensive use of Roman symbols and iconography, such as the fasces (a bundle of rods with an axe), which became the emblem of the Fascist movement. The term \"fascism\" itself is derived from the Italian word \"fascio,\" meaning a bundle or group, evoking the strength and unity of the ancient Roman state. Mussolini also launched a massive campaign of archaeological excavations and restorations in Rome, seeking to uncover and glorify the city's ancient heritage as a symbol of Italy's destiny to rule the Mediterranean world.\n\nAdolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), in turn, drew heavily on the myth of the Aryan race, a supposed group of ancient Indo-European warriors who were seen as the ancestors of the Germanic peoples. Hitler's ideology was suffused with references to Norse mythology, Germanic paganism, and the warrior virtues of strength, loyalty, and racial identity. The National Socialists appropriated and reinterpreted many Proto-Indo-European symbols and narratives, such as the swastika (an ancient Indo-European sun symbol) and the concept of the Herrenrasse (master race), to justify their vision of German supremacy and the expansion of German territory.\n\nThe British Empire, with its long history of colonial expansion and global dominance, also drew on its Germanic heritage of conquest and exploration. The ideal of the brave, resourceful British adventurer, embodied in figures like Cecil Rhodes and T.E. Lawrence, echoed the ancient Proto-Indo-European warrior archetype, even as the empire itself began to unravel in the face of nationalist resistance and the costs of the World Wars.\n\nThe rise of fascism and National Socialism set the stage for another devastating global conflict, World War II. The war was not just a clash of nations, but a clash of ideologies, with the Axis powers seeking to revive the ancient Roman Empire under a new Proto-Indo-European model of racial hierarchy and martial glory.\n\nThe Allied victory in 1945 marked a turning point in European history. The defeat of Germany and Italy, and the subsequent partition and occupation of Germany, dealt a crushing blow to the fascist and National Socialist visions of a resurgent warrior culture. The revelations of the atrocities committed during the war, including the systematic murder of millions of Jews and other groups, discredited the ideologies that had fueled the Axis war effort.\n\nIn the decades following World War II, Europe faced a profound existential crisis. The devastation of the war, combined with the decline of colonial empires and the rise of competing superpowers, left many Europeans questioning their place in the world and the foundations of their cultural identity.\n\nOne significant change in the post-war era was the increased integration of Jews into European society. Prior to World War I, Jews had faced significant discrimination and marginalization in many European countries. However, the shared trauma of the war and the democratic ideals of the post-war period led to a greater acceptance of Jews in public life and a reduction in anti-Jewish attitudes.\n\nDespite the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of millions of Jews, the post-war period saw a remarkable resilience and resurgence of Jewish life in Europe and around the world. The creation of the State of Israel in 1948, the culmination of the Zionist movement that had begun in the late 19th century, provided a focal point for Jewish identity and a haven for survivors of the Holocaust.\n\nThe Zionist movement, deeply rooted in the history and traditions of Second Temple Judaism, saw the return to the ancient homeland as a way to reconnect with the Jewish past and to fulfil the biblical promise of redemption. In this sense, the Zionist narrative shared some similarities with the historical narratives that inspired the Germans and Italians in their search for ancient origins. Just as the Nazis looked to the myth of the Aryan race and the Italians to the glories of Rome, the Zionists drew on the history of ancient Israel and the Second Temple period as a source of inspiration and legitimacy for their political project.\n\nThe establishment of Israel provided a focal point for Jewish identity and a haven for Holocaust survivors, but also caused significant instability in the Middle East through repeated conflicts between Israel and its Arab neighbors. This contributed to the rise of a more virulent, anti-Western form of Islam that was in sharp contrast to the more modern and secular Islam that had existed in the region prior to the 1950s.\n\nWhile Europeans found themselves increasingly disconnected from their cultural roots and traditions in the post-war era, the Jewish people managed to preserve a strong sense of ethnic and religious identity, anchored in centuries of shared experience and perseverance. Despite the traumas of the Holocaust and centuries of marginalization across Europe, Jewish communities maintained robust social institutions, cultural practices, and belief systems rooted in the traditions of Rabbinic Judaism. This continuity of identity provided a sense of rootedness and belonging even as Jews became integrated into the modern nation-states of Europe. From Jewish schools and community centers to vibrant traditions like Shabbat observance and life-cycle rituals, the Jewish people wielded their multi-generational cultural inheritance as a bulwark against the disorienting tides of secularization and social upheaval facing the broader European populace. As their Christian neighbours drifted from traditional religious moorings, the Jewish commitment to preserving their ancient way of life facilitated stronger communal bonds and clearer self-understanding - a powerful legacy stemming from the very same monotheism and covenantal roots that set the Jews apart in the ancient world.\n\nThe post-war era saw a rapid acceleration of the process of secularization in the West, as traditional Christian beliefs and practices lost their hold on society. The horrors of the war, combined with the rise of new ideologies and social movements, led many people to question the relevance and authority of religion in the modern world.\n\nOne of the most significant of these social movements was feminism, which gained momentum in the post-war era as women sought to build on the gains they had made during the war and to challenge the traditional gender roles and power structures that had long oppressed them. The loss of millions of young men in the war had created new opportunities for women to enter the workforce and public life, and many were determined not to let those opportunities slip away.\n\nThe feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, in particular, represented a radical challenge to the patriarchal values and institutions of Western society. Women demanded equal rights and opportunities in education, employment, and politics, and challenged the traditional division of labor that confined them to the domestic sphere. They also fought for greater control over their own bodies and reproductive choices, seeing this as essential to their liberation from male domination.\n\nThe rise of feminism, along with the normalization of single women and childlessness in the post-war period, had a significant impact on fertility rates in Western societies. As women gained greater autonomy and opportunities outside of the traditional family structure, they began to delay or forgo marriage and childbearing. This trend, combined with the widespread availability of contraception and changing social norms, led to a dramatic decline in fertility rates across the Western world in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nToday, many Western countries, particularly in Europe, have fertility rates well below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, leading to aging populations and concerns about the long-term sustainability of social welfare systems. This demographic shift stands in stark contrast to the higher fertility rates seen among immigrant Muslim populations in Europe, many of whom maintain more traditional family structures and cultural values.\n\nThe rise of feminism can be seen as both a cause and a consequence of the decline of Christianity in the post-war era. As women gained greater autonomy and influence in society, they began to question the patriarchal assumptions and values that had long been enshrined in Christian theology and practice. At the same time, the decline of traditional religion created a vacuum that was filled in part by the new secular ideologies of feminism and other progressive movements.\n\nThe post-war period also saw significant changes in the demographic makeup of Western Europe, as countries turned to mass immigration to help rebuild their shattered economies and societies. In the 1950s and 1960s, millions of workers from former colonies and other parts of the developing world were recruited to work in the factories, mines, and service industries of countries like Britain, France, and Germany.\n\nWhile these immigrants played a vital role in the post-war economic boom, their presence also led to significant social and cultural tensions, as they brought with them new languages, customs, and religious traditions that sometimes clashed with the dominant culture of their host societies. In particular, the growth of Muslim communities in Europe, fuelled by immigration from countries like Pakistan, Turkey, and Morocco, began to reshape the religious landscape of the continent and to challenge long-held assumptions about European identity and values.\n\nAs Muslim communities grew in size and influence, they began to assert their own cultural and religious identity, establishing mosques, schools, and other institutions that served as focal points for community life. At the same time, the rise of political Islam and the emergence of radical Islamist movements in the Muslim world began to have an impact on Muslim communities in Europe, leading to tensions and conflicts with the wider society.\n\nThese tensions were exacerbated by the economic and social marginalization of many Muslim immigrants and their descendants. This sense of exclusion and alienation, combined with the influence of radical Islamist ideologies, led some young Muslims to embrace extremist views and to engage in acts of violence and terrorism, further fueling anti-Muslim sentiment and polarizing European societies.\n\nThe cumulative impact of these developments - the devastating World Wars, the decline of Christianity, the rise of feminism and secularism, and the growth of Muslim communities - left Europe in a state of profound identity crisis and uncertainty. The old certainties of faith and tradition had been shattered, leaving many people searching for new sources of meaning and belonging in an increasingly diverse and globalized world.\n\nThis sense of confusion and despondency amongst non-Jewish Europeans has been compounded by the challenges of immigration, multiculturalism, and globalization, which have raised questions about the very nature of European identity and the future of the continent. The challenges of immigration, including Muslim refugees fleeing Middle East conflicts tied to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and Islamic extremism, have caused significant social unrest. As Europe becomes more diverse and interconnected, many Europeans are struggling to define what it means to be European in the 21st century and to find a way forward that honors their cultural heritage while adapting to the realities of the modern world.\n\nFinally, one could argue that part of Europe's crisis of meaning stems from an excess of compassion - a laudable value rooted in Judeo-Christian ethics, but one that has paradoxically contributed to an unmooring from traditional sources of identity. The humanitarian values that underpin modern European liberalism, with its embrace of multiculturalism, secularism, and universal human rights, represent a departure from the particularistic cultural chauvinism that forged ancient and medieval European identity. While compassion is laudable, this universalizing ethos has opened the door to cultural self-negation, as nations rooted in ethnic, linguistic, and religious specificity struggle to maintain coherent identities in the face of foreign immigration, value relativism, and the elevation of individual autonomy over communal belonging. What was once a proud ethnic and religious inheritance rooted in ancestral warrior traditions has been subsumed by an abstract, borderless humanitarianism. For a civilization formed by the interplay of Indo-European conquerors and Judeo-Christian ethnoreligious currents, unchecked compassion may have become a civilizational vulnerability, leaving modern Europeans unrooted from the particularistic identities that spawned their cultural achievements.\n\nPart 7: Debating the Future on the Ruins of the Past: Nationalism, Feminism, and the Meaning of the West\n\nAs we have seen throughout this article, the history of Western civilization has been shaped by the complex interplay of different cultural, religious, and ideological forces, each vying for dominance and influence in the public sphere. In the early 21st century, a new ideological movement has emerged that seeks to challenge the dominant cultural and political order: the rise of progressive ideology and its struggle for cultural hegemony.\n\nThe origins of progressive ideology can be traced back to the social and cultural upheavals of the mid-20th century, particularly the rise of feminism and other progressive movements that sought to challenge traditional gender roles and power structures. In the early 21st century, these movements have coalesced into a new ideological framework that emphasizes the importance of identity, diversity, and social justice in all areas of life.\n\nAt the heart of progressive ideology is a critique of Western civilization as fundamentally oppressive and unjust, shaped by centuries of racism, sexism, and other forms of systemic inequality. Progressive activists argue that the dominant cultural narratives and institutions of the West, from the media and education system to the political and economic order, are designed to perpetuate the power and privilege of white, male, and heterosexual elites at the expense of marginalized groups.\n\nTo challenge this system of oppression, progressive ideology emphasizes the importance of identity and lived experience in shaping our understanding of the world. It rejects the idea of objective truth or universal values, instead privileging the subjective experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups as the basis for knowledge and moral authority.\n\nProgressive ideology also places a strong emphasis on intersectionality, the idea that different forms of oppression and discrimination are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. According to this view, the experience of marginalization and oppression is shaped by the intersection of multiple identities, such as race, gender, sexuality, and class, and can only be fully understood and addressed through an intersectional lens.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the rise of progressive ideology has been its ability to capture key institutions and shape public discourse, often with the backing of state power. In recent years, progressive ideas have become increasingly influential in a wide range of domains, from education and the media to corporate America and government bureaucracy.\n\nIn the realm of education, for example, progressives have pushed for the adoption of \"anti-racist\" curricula and the creation of \"safe spaces\" and \"trigger warnings\" to protect students from potentially offensive or traumatic content. In the media, progressive ideas have shaped coverage of issues like policing, immigration, and gender identity, with journalists and editors often facing pressure to conform to progressive orthodoxies or risk being \"canceled\" by online mobs.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, progressive ideology has also made inroads into the halls of power, with elected officials and government bureaucrats increasingly embracing the language and priorities of social justice activism. From the adoption of \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" as guiding principles for public policy to the use of \"diversity training\" and \"implicit bias\" tests as tools for shaping organizational culture, progressive ideas have become embedded in the very fabric of the modern state.\n\nIn this sense, the rise of progressive ideology can be seen as a new form of cultural hegemony, one that seeks to reshape society in its own image and marginalize or silence dissenting voices. Just as the Christian church once used its influence to shape the laws, customs, and beliefs of medieval Europe, so too are modern institutions and governments using their authority to promote and enforce progressive orthodoxies. The fact that it is still possible to debate these issues shows that this capture is not yet complete. It took Christianity decades to capture the state apparatus of the Roman Empire after the support of Constantine.\n\nWhile progressive ideology presents itself as a champion of diversity and inclusion, its relationship with Islam and Muslim communities in the West is complex and often fraught with tension. On the one hand, progressives have been vocal in their support for Muslim civil rights and in their opposition to Islamophobia and discrimination against Muslims. They have criticized policies like the \"Muslim ban\" and the surveillance of Muslim communities as examples of systemic racism and oppression.\n\nOn the other hand, many of the core values and beliefs of traditional Islam, particularly those related to gender roles and sexuality, are in direct conflict with secular and progressive ideals. Islam is a deeply patriarchal religion that emphasizes the importance of traditional gender roles and the subordination of women to male authority. It also has a long history of intolerance towards homosexuality and other forms of sexual diversity.\n\nThis tension between the inclusive and egalitarian rhetoric of progressive ideology and the exclusive and hierarchical values of traditional Islam has created a complex and often contradictory dynamic in Western societies. While progressives may champion the rights of Muslim minorities and condemn Islamophobia, they are often less vocal in their criticism of the oppressive and illiberal aspects of Islamic culture and religion.\n\nAt the same time, the rise of progressive ideology has also fuelled a backlash among some segments of the Muslim community, who see it as a threat to their traditional values and way of life. Some conservative Muslims have accused progressives of promoting a form of cultural imperialism that seeks to impose Western secular values on Muslim societies, while others have embraced a more fundamentalist and militant form of Islam as a way of resisting what they see as the corrupting influence of Western culture.\n\nThe rise of progressive ideology in the early 21st century bears striking similarities to the way in which Christianity came to dominate the Roman Empire in the 4th century. Just as Christianity started out as one of many competing belief systems in the pluralistic world of late antiquity, only to be embraced by the Roman state and imposed as the official religion, so too has progressive ideology moved from the fringes of academic and activist circles to capture key institutions and shape public discourse, often with the backing of state power.\n\nWhat is unique about the current moment, however, is the simultaneous dismantling of traditional European values and culture, combined with mass immigration of non-Europeans. It is not only the culture that is disappearing but also the descendants of the Proto-Indo-Europeans who swept across Europe 6,500 years ago. Declining fertility rates among indigenous Europeans, fueled by the legacy of the World Wars and the rise of feminism and secularism, have created a demographic vacuum that is being filled by immigrant populations with higher birth rates and more traditional cultural values.\n\nThis demographic shift, combined with the erosion of traditional cultural norms and the rise of progressive ideology, has created a profound sense of dislocation and uncertainty among many Europeans, who feel that their way of life and their very identity is under threat. As the Jewish experience has shown, the preservation of cultural and religious identity in the face of adversity requires a deep commitment to tradition and a strong sense of communal solidarity. Whether Europeans will be able to muster the same level of resilience and adaptability in the face of these challenges remains to be seen.\n\nWrapping things up\n\nThis exploration of the history of Western civilisation, from the ancient Proto-Indo-Europeans to the rise of progressive ideology in the 21st century, has revealed a complex tapestry of cultural, religious, and ideological influences that have shaped the Western world in profound and often contradictory ways.\n\nAt the heart of this story lies the tension between the warrior ethos of the Proto-Indo-Europeans, with its emphasis on glory, honour, and conquest, and the monotheism of Judaism and Christianity, with their focus on compassion, justice, and the inherent dignity of all human beings. These two worldviews have clashed and intertwined throughout Western history, shaping everything from the myths and legends of the ancient world to the political and social movements of the modern era.\n\nWe have seen how the Judeo-Christian tradition challenged the pagan warrior ethos of the Greeks and Romans, offering a new vision of morality and human worth that would transform the Western world. At the same time, we have witnessed how Christianity itself was transformed by its encounter with the Greco-Roman world, absorbing elements of the warrior ethos and the classical tradition even as it sought to transcend them.\n\nThe rise of Islam in the medieval period added another layer of complexity to this story, as the Muslim world emerged as both a rival and a source of cultural and intellectual exchange for the Christian West. The Crusades and the Reconquista, as well as the long history of Islamic rule in Spain and the Balkans, left a lasting mark on Western culture and identity, one that continues to shape debates over religion, immigration , and belonging today.\n\nIn the modern era, we have traced the gradual unraveling of the Christian consensus and the rise of secular ideologies that sought to fill the void left by the decline of traditional religion. From the Enlightenment philosophers to the nationalist and socialist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, these new belief systems often drew on the same warrior ethos that had animated the ancient world, glorifying strength, courage, and self-sacrifice for the sake of a higher cause.\n\nAt the same time, we have explored the complex and often overlooked role of women in shaping Western culture and society, from the early Christian martyrs and mystics to the suffragettes and feminist activists of the modern era. The struggle for women's rights and gender equality has been a constant thread throughout Western history, one that has intersected with and challenged the dominant cultural and religious narratives of each age.\n\nThe devastating impact of the two World Wars on the demographic balance of Europe cannot be overstated. The loss of millions of young men not only reshaped the workforce and social roles of women but also had a lasting impact on fertility rates and family structures. The post-war normalization of single women and childlessness, combined with the rise of feminism and the sexual revolution, led to a dramatic decline in birth rates among indigenous European populations, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nIn contrast, immigrant Muslim communities in Europe have maintained higher fertility rates, reflecting their more traditional family values and cultural norms. This demographic disparity has added a new layer of complexity to the debates over immigration, integration, and national identity in contemporary Europe, as the continent grapples with the challenges of an aging population and the need for cultural and social renewal.\n\nWe have seen how the Jewish people have endured and thrived throughout the centuries. It is remarkable and admirable how they have been able to maintain their unique religious and cultural identity in the face of persecution, exile, and genocide.\n\nFinally, we have seen how history has echoes. The capture of the apparatus of the Roman state by Christianity and its subsequent suppression of the values that made Rome great are highly reminiscent of the gradual capture of the institutions and government in much of the West by progressive ideologies today. The intolerance of progressive ideology may appear to be something that can be ignored by the majority. But the take over of the Roman world by Christianity should be a warning to us all. Any ideology that believes that they have a monopoly on what is right and wrong is bad. When an ideology has the backing of the state it can be terrifying and murderous.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher.\n\nThe 150-Year Life: How Radical Longevity Will Transform Our World",

At the time, however, women had to break the law many times in order for their voices to be heard and to achieve their goal. Breaking the law was the right moral thing to do.\n\nInterracial marriage. Blacks were not allowed to marry whites in most part of the United States until 1967. Today, racial purity is becoming increasingly blurred in much of the United States where combinations of black-white-asian-hispanic peoples are becoming relatively common. Yet this change in legislation was extremely controversial and white Americans believed that allowing blacks to intermarry with whites would challenge white racial supremacy. Today the thought of banning two consenting adults from marrying each other on the basis of their race seems absurd. Fighting to change the law was the right moral thing to do.\n\nSo herein lies a big question. Who, or what, should be the arbiter of what is legal or morally right?\n\nLaws are written by legislators. Legislators are elected by the general public. Thus the general public has a clear, albeit indirect, impact on what is legal and illegal. The problem is that the elected representative receives a mandate to act on behalf of his/her constituents but does not necessarily vote for what the electorate actually wants.\n\nBut what is morally right? In the West it used to be that Christian beliefs and The Ten Commandments provided the foundation of what was morally right. Yet Christian doctrine is full of \"laws\" that are quite questionable in the modern world. It provided a lot of the moral justification needed to validate slavery, for example.\n\nThe reality is that moral convictions change over time. This evolution in beliefs explains the change in attitudes towards homosexual marriage for example. In 1983 only 21% of Britons believed that homosexuality was 'rarely wrong or not wrong at all'. By 2012 57% of Britains felt the same way.\n\nThe law is often out of sync with moral convictions. There is a lag between what is deemed morally acceptable and what is enshrined in law. If enough people think that something is morally acceptable, over time you can expect legislators to catch up and pass or repeal laws to allow that behaviour.\n\nIn the meantime, early adopters to morally right viewpoints appear to be on the fringes of society. Their views will not be deemed acceptable and behaviours that they propose will frequently be illegal.\n\nAs a free society it is important that those people are protected from unnecessary persecution and that their illegal behaviour is not excessively repressed.\n\nWhile we may not agree with them today, they might be providing the moral guidance that we need to change the laws of tomorrow.\n\nIs Democracy The Opium Of The Masses?",

How far will emigration go?\n\nColonies of Space\n\nElon Musk, the co-founder of PayPal, founder of SpaceX, which delivers cargo to the International Space Station and is the founder of Tesla, the electric car company, wants to create an 80,000 person colony on Mars. The trip there would cost about $500,000 per person: essentially the life savings of wealthy citizens in developed countries. Colonists should not expect to ever return to Earth. The thought of never being able to return home, and spending all your money to make the trip is nothing extraordinary for humans - that is what we have been doing for over 60,000 years.\n\nMars has almost exactly the same surface area as Earth (which is bigger but is mainly covered by oceans), so there is plenty of space. Humans have successfully lived in hostile climates, like the arctic and in deserts, and although Mars is even more hostile than anything on Earth, modern technology should make it easier to adapt there and to maintain larger numbers. Once Mars has been colonised, why not the Moon or even the stars?\n\nThis sounds exciting and vaguely plausible. Early exploration and colonisation on Earth was, due to the limited technology and knowledge, expensive and very dangerous. Colonising the Solar System and the stars would also be expensive and dangerous, but prices would come down and the dangers would be managed.\n\nBut also perhaps pointless.\n\nEither we are alone in the Universe or we are not\n\nOne of the great puzzles of science is the question: \"Are we alone in the universe?\" Arthur C Clarke, the famous science fiction writer who wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey , famously said:\n\n\"Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.\"\n\nIf other sentient species existed in the Universe they would also have a drive to emigrate, due to the same pressures that have driven humans. This would suggest that they would be driven to colonise other planets and solar systems and that the Universe would be teeming with intelligent life. But since we have not found any intelligent life, other than on Earth, the assumption is that there is no other intelligent life and we are alone. Hence Arthur C Clarke's comment that 'we are alone in the Universe' is the terrifying likelihood.\n\nBut there is a third possibility, and that is that at a certain point in time intelligent life becomes so advanced that it become pointless to colonise other planets and solar systems.\n\nAnd humans are rapidly approaching that point, thanks to advances in technological breakthroughs that have given us computing power and worlds of virtual reality.\n\nLets go back to the purpose of emigration. Curiosity is a key driver for some people, but they are a minority and it would have been hard to justify the risks of taking your family away from their community just because of curiosity. Instead, most humans are pretty content where they are and have no real desire to move even if where they are is not that great. Why would humans choose to settle in a desert or in the arctic?\n\nHumans move because something compels them. There is not enough space, or food, or not enough security. If someone has discovered something better - more space, more food, more security etc - then they can be both pulled and pushed to emigrate.\n\nIf you were to emigrate to Elon Musk's colony in Mars you would be guaranteed the following: food would be bad (vegetarian only); accommodation would be cramped, you could only go outside at great expense; discomfort and risk, the climate would be a mixture of a desert and the arctic; your legal rights and colony governance would be quite different to what you are used to as the new colony may blend a mixture of Earth based laws and new Martian based laws. And, above all, you could never go back and see your family again.\n\nColonies of the Mind\n\nWhat if you were presented a nicer, alternative, place to emigrate to? You could have a luxury house as big as you liked, any kind of view that you wanted, fine clothes, furniture and the best art; cooks and cleaners to tend your needs, people who were like you and had your interests. You could have your ideal legal system and governance structure. Anything that you could imagine you could have. You could even live \"forever\". A type of paradise.\n\nThe catch is that while the Martian colony would be \"real\" the alternative colony would be virtual reality.\n\nThe ultimate form of virtual reality is something similar to that portrayed in The Matrix: a virtual world so real that it is impossible to distinguish between the real world and the virtual world. We are not that far off: modern sci-fi and action films routinely show digitally created worlds and characters that are impossible to distinguish from the real world.\n\nThe technology to create a visually perfect virtual reality world already exists, albeit unevenly distributed and expensive. But Moore's Law, which predicted a doubling of computing power every 18 months, still seems to work, after 60 years. The new Sony Playstation 4 and Microsoft X-Box One games consoles, released in 2013, already demonstrate real time computer animation that is almost photo realistic. In the 20 years before any rudimentary and expensive Mars colony is available computing power will have doubled 13 times and a cheap games console will have the power of today's fastest and most expensive super-computers. That is more than enough processing power to access any virtual world that you could imagine.\n\nSo in 20 years time perhaps millions of people will be living the bulk of their lives in multiple virtual reality worlds of their choosing with their own unique economies and social systems. A parallel real economy will cater for their real needs with simple food and simple shelter. The cost to house, feed and maintain the real world population would be significantly cheaper than the cost of maintaining a Western family today, potentially enabling the population to reach 10 billion people without too much difficulty or conflict.\n\nGiven the expense and discomfort of \"real\" colonisation to other planets virtual colonisation may be a far more appealing alternative, and not just for humans but for other alien species in our galaxy as well, which may well explain the apparent absence of intelligent life despite there being possibly millions of Earth-like planets in our galaxy.\n\nAs more people 'emigrate' to these 'Colonies of the Mind' it may even reduce pressures on Earth so that more of the planet can be returned to its natural habitat, resulting in a resurgence of biodiversity and life.\n\nBut perhaps the only way we will see that is in a virtual world catering for idealists and environmentalists!\n\nWhy God Needs The Government: Multiculturalism Vs Monotheism",

Winston Churchill frequently pops up in the context of a discussion that he had with Stalin on how they would be remembered by history. Another is George Orwell, the writer of \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\".\n\nIn February 1944, Orwell wrote an article in the Tribune , where he was a regular columnist, that includes the line \"History is written by the winners.\"\n\nIn the article he described his concern that history is unreliable as it is typically written by the victors in a conflict and that the losers have their point of view written out of the narrative or distorted. Orwell participated in the Spanish Civil War and he wrote:\n\nDuring the Spanish civil war I found myself feeling very strongly that a true history of this war never would or could be written. Accurate ﬁgures, objective accounts of what was happening, simply did not exist. And if I felt that even in 1937, when the Spanish Government was still in being, and the lies which the various Republican factions were telling about each other and about the enemy were relatively small ones, how does the case stand now? Even if Franco is overthrown, what kind of records will the future historian have to go upon? And if Franco or anyone at all resembling him remains in power, the history of the war will consist quite largely of \"facts\" which millions of people now living know to be lies. One of these \"facts\", for instance, is that there was a considerable Russian army in Spain. There exists the most abundant evidence that there was no such army. Yet if Franco remains in power, and if Fascism in general survives, that Russian army will go into the history books and future school children will believe in it. So for practical purposes the lie will have become truth.\n\nHe went on to say that:\n\nThis kind of thing is happening all the time. Out of the milions of instances which must be available, I will choose one which happens to be veriﬁable. During part of 1941 and 1942, when the Luftwaffe was busy in Russia, the German radio regaled its home audiences with stories of devestating air raids on London. Now, we are aware that those raids did not happen. But what use would our knowledge be if the Germans conquered Britain? For the purposes of a future historian, did those raids happen, or didn't they? The answer is: If Hitler survives, they happened, and if he falls they didn't happen. So with innumerable other events of the past ten or twenty years. Is the Protocols of the Elders of Zion a genuine document? Did Trotsky plot with the Nazis? How many German aeroplanes were shot down in the Battle of Britain? Does Europe welcome the New Order? In no case do you get one answer which is universally accepted because it is true: in each case you get a number of totally incompatible answers, one of which is ﬁnally adopted as the result of a physical struggle. History is written by the winners.\n\nHistory Future Now thought about George Orwell's comments at a recent TEDx talk held at Eton, England, on 14th March 2017. Misan Sagay, a black British screen writer and film producer, talked about how our perception of history is typically biased towards the white British writers who wrote about British history. Her talk was excellent and worth watching in full. She showed two photographs of the Burma campaign in World War Two; one was of a group of white British soldiers (actually Alex Guinness staring in the classic movie \"A Bridge over the River Kwai\"); the other was of Indian colonial troops serving the British Empire. Both were there, but British people are typically only aware of the white English troops and not the colonial troops. She argued that there was more to history and to storytelling than the white perspective.\n\nShe clearly has a point. It also makes for more interesting history - the white perspective has been chronicled extensively and historians of all ethnic backgrounds continuously search for new ways of telling old stories. It keeps them fresh and employed.\n\nBut it also highlights the change in the ethnic makeup of Britain and other European countries. After World War Two, millions of Europeans were forcibly moved from one country to another as the post war borders were established. Countries were, in essence, ethnically cleansed and what was left was a series of nation states made up of groups of people from one major ethnic group. By the end of the war some 60 million Europeans had been displaced. Some academics estimate that over 12.5 million Germans were kicked out of former German lands in eastern Europe and became refugees. New Germany became more German. New Poland became more Polish. The Ukraine became more Ukrainian. This was a refugee crisis of epic proportions.\n\nThe histories told in those countries typically have their ethnic group as being the stars of the story. That makes sense, in the same way that selfies are one of the most popular forms of photographs. We like to see how we look, not just to ourselves but to others as well.\n\nAs mass immigration has swept over Europe, with Europeans taking full advantage of free movement of people as part of the European Union experiment and non-Europeans entering from former colonies and the developing world, the post-war monoculture has ended.\n\nFor non-natives, the dominant narrative of history of their adopted country seems either false, or irrelevant to them. For example, many Muslim immigrants to Europe do not necessarily see the Holocaust as a terrible stain on European morality - as perceived by most native Europeans - but as either exaggerated nonsense promoted by Jews to justify policies in Israel or as something that did not go far enough. Anti semitism is on the rise in Europe - but it is not native Europeans who are pushing this agenda.\n\nAs the non-native population of European countries increases every year, the old ethno-centric narrative history that was understood as \"fact\" by a country will change. In Britain, the Burma campaign will not be about a few white British officers but will be about the suffering of Indian troops. The European discovery of America will not be a triumph of European ingenuity and expansion but will be a shameful epic of genocide of native amerindians.\n\nAs Misay Sagay said, history provides more than just an interesting story. It conveys to a group a sense of worth. It is a defence against those who would wish us harm. While we may be defeated, we can point to the triumphs of our ancestors and grasp onto a sense of value and importance. It is completely rational for non- native Europeans who live in Europe to want to insert themselves into the narrative of history. The traditional history that they see is alien or irrelevant. They need to establish their own value and importance within the European story.\n\nBut it is also an issue for native- Europeans at the same time. While they may live in a European country, their own narrative history is being challenged by the new history of the non-native Europeans. Native Europeans used to be the stars. They are gradually moving out of the limelight and eventually, as the non-native European numbers inexorably increase year after year, they will be pushed into the shadows. Their own heroes may even be co-opted by the new Europeans: Misay Sagay described, in her TED talk, the famous French writer Alexandre Dumas - he who wrote The Three Musketeers and the Count of Monte Cristo - as being \"black\". Dumas was born and lived his entire life in France. His grandmother was a black slave from what is now Haiti, his other three grandparents white French. If Misay Sagay's story is recounted often enough \"the lie will have become truth.\"\n\nGeorge Orwell was right when he said that \"history is written by the winners.\" The winners are the group that dominates, either after a battle, or simply by sheer numbers. Native Europeans are losing the numbers game, and with it they will lose their history.",

With this level of support, verging on veneration, it is assumed by many that everything he said was equally great.\n\nBut was Churchill right? Was he right about democracy?\n\nDemocracy today is in a terrible state in many of the most advanced democratic countries in the world. Many people believe that the political system is broken. Politicians are corrupt at best and incompetent at worst. The democratic system does not appear to work effectively and this raises questions about the political legitimacy of democratically elected governments.\n\nDon't you think it curious that democracy - the concept of one person getting one, equal, vote - is rarely used in other aspects of human social organisation? Is an army General democratically elected by comrades in arms? No. Is a hospital surgeon democratically elected by fellow doctors? No. Is a head teacher democratically elected by fellow teachers? No. Is a company CEO democratically elected by fellow employees? No.\n\nEven in families, that most personal of social organisations, there is no democracy. Parents run their homes as paternalistic benevolent dictatorships. We literally grow up being told what to do by authority figures, at home, at kindergarten, at primary school, at secondary school and even at university. This system can continue throughout our working lives.\n\nSo why is a president elected democratically? Why are our congressmen, senators and members of parliament elected? What makes us think that politics should work so differently? Democracy did not form spontaneously. It was created. It has evolved since it was created, do doubt. But the political system was created by people who had power in the first place. People who apparently gave up that power and voluntarily handed it to other people.\n\nBut one thing we know about human nature is that once you have power it is very hard to give it up.\n\nWhich raises an interesting question. Did they ever actually cede power? Is the growing dissatisfaction with democracy merely the realisation that democracy is merely an illusion? Are we like Dorothy pulling back the curtain to see that the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz is nothing more than a terrified old man pulling levers? We are disappointed and frustrated.\n\nIs democracy the opium of the masses, used to dull our senses so that we do not realise we are powerless?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWho Benefits From Our Increased Social Fragmentation?",

Basics of clean water and hygienic, clean equipment and spaces in surgery when conducting operations saved millions of people who would have otherwise died.\n\nHealthy children needed to be fed...\n\nThis science-led health bonus of longevity ushered in a new crisis. Children who would have died as infants survived and became mouths to feed, mouths which required more food. Larger families also meant that land and other family assets had to be shared amongst more children (unless families followed the practice of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited almost all and his siblings almost nothing). Thus farms and estates were divided into such small parts that they became unviable within a few generations. For many Europeans the vast expanses of north and south America provided a solution to this crisis, the promise of a land of opportunity. Migration allowed the population of the Americas to swell with the arrival of second, third and fourth sons. More food become available in the home country as well. This benefit came as a result of scientific advances in agriculture: better forms of mechanisation, fertilisers, irrigation and high yielding seeds.\n\nMany of those who could not take the expensive and risky trip to the New World moved to the expanding cities where factory jobs replaced farm labour. Large families living on farms had the luxury of outdoor space. Food could be plucked from trees or dug up from the ground. In cities families were crammed into small spaces with no gardens. The only way to get more food was to earn money to pay for it, steal it or to be given it. And while the easy spread of disease in such conditions helped to curtail the size of the city population, it was not enough to prevent rapid expansion. These cities of the late 1700s and the 1800s provided the literary backdrop to the great works of Victor Hugo (Les Miserables) and Charles Dickens (Oliver Twist).\n\n...life in the city caused widespread misery\n\nThe stresses of city life changed things in the bedroom too. The human need for sex - for pleasure - resulted in too many surviving children, which resulted in misery. Too many children caused stress on family income.\n\nChildren were sent out to work in factories at an early age and mothers did their best to either deny sex to their husbands rather than risk pregnancy. Many women were forced into experimenting with herbal remedies or to seek clumsy abortions to abort an unwanted child. Large numbers of women living in the confines of cities also resulted in levels of prostitution that would never have been seen in the country.\n\nCondoms have been used for centuries. Syphilis, a horrible sexually transmitted disease brought over by Europeans from Central America in the 1490s, (Europeans gave the Americas small pox, which was far more deadly) could be stopped from transferring through sexual contact by the use of condoms -usually made from sheep's gut. Typically the use of condoms was restricted to the upper and middle classes, but by the 1820s poorer people were using them as well. Made-to-measure, re-usable rubber condoms that just covered the glans became popular from the 1850s; these were later replaced by mass produced condoms of a uniform size dubbed \"all in ones\" which were sold in pharmacies. While the use and sale of condoms had political and religious impacts, it was the Pill, which became widely available in the late 1960s, for married women, and in the early 1970s, for unmarried women that definitively ended the union of pleasure and procreation.\n\nCondoms and the Pill allowed for the separation of pleasure from procreation...\n\nWithout condoms and the contraceptive pill the population is likely to have been significantly higher than it is today. The pill also heralded a new sexual liberalisation for women, a social revolution that is still unfolding. The separation of pleasure and procreation allowed for far greater promiscuity than previously. Sex could be seen as a \"recreation\" without risk of pregnancy. Young people in the 1970s could have sex without the need to commit to marriage and those in marriage could have affairs without the risk of getting caught out by a surprise baby.\n\nOn a more serious note, women were far more able to study at university and stay in the workforce for longer, bringing in the rise of the career woman and greater gender equality at work. Many women delayed childbirth for so long that a new issue emerged - infertility. Science stepped in once again, with in- vitro fertilisation. The first successful birth through this method took place in 1978. Surrogate mothers, test-tube babies and other developments have allowed women to have their own children well into their 40s and 50s.\n\nNeonatal medical improvements have also increased the survival rates of pre-term babies, shortening the overall time required to be in the mother's womb.\n\nIn the 1990s adoptions of children from former Soviet block countries also became popular, only to be supplanted by adoptions of children from China in the 2000s. Procreation has become so divorced from the act of sex that these changes are now socially normal and acceptable.\n\nWhich also perhaps explains the widespread acceptance of homosexuality among people under 30. If sex is for pleasure, and not children, and you can have children whether or not you can actually produce them biologically.\n\nWhat then is the difference between a heterosexual couple and a homosexual couples? If a heterosexual marriage is no longer linked to having natural children, why should children be denied to homosexual couples?\n\nIn turn differing attitudes have implications for the western institution of marriage itself. In the Christian West, marriage has become synonymous with a church wedding. In fact, prior to the 1550s when the marriage ceremony was introduced in the Common Book of Prayer in England (the now famous words: \"To have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part\"), marriages did not need to take place in a church or even need to be officiated by a church official.\n\nCivil weddings now form the legal contract for marriage in most European countries today. A church service may be seen as an add-on with a strong social rationale and sometimes a religious one. Today, more couples live together and have children, without bothering to get married at all - not even entering a legally recognised civil partnership. In Holland, there is a legal status of \"samenlevingscontract\" (\"living-together-contract\") which co-habiting couples can apply for which give some legal protections, but is not technically a marriage. The Dutch agreement sets out how the couple will share the costs of living together, pay rent, raise children and divide property if, and when, they separate.\n\n...all of which has had far reaching implications on the concept of marriage\n\nSo if sex is for pleasure and not necessarily linked to procreation and if heterosexual couples live together without being married or without a legal civil partnerships, it can be seen that it makes very little logical sense to be against homosexual marriage. The \"yuk\" factor is relatively transient. When the first marriages of whites and blacks took place in the US there was also a feeling of outrage and disgust. To many people, to this day, while interracial marriage seems undesirable, it is no longer deemed \"unnatural\".\n\nBut where do the boundaries of marriage end? Interracial marriage and now homosexual marriage have become acceptable, so why not other concepts? In the Muslim world multiple wives, polygamy, is not only widespread but also legally binding. Mormons were famously polygamous until 1890 when they abandoned the practice, which allowed for the admission of Utah as a State into the United States of America. If Dutch style \"samenlevingscontracten\" were to be adopted outside Holland, they could be modified to incorporate a whole range of legal co-habitations, ranging from one male to many women to many males to many women and everything in between.\n\nSo, far, so very conventional: the advent of modern contraceptives and fertility treatments has resulted in the separation of pleasure and procreation. This has led to the downfall of the concept of heterosexual marriage as the framework for the raising of children. But there is another change in society that will have a further impact on the number of children being born into developed or Western societies: jobs.\n\nFor the first time in history more people live in cities than they do in the country. One key consequence of this is that in a city there is no such thing as a free lunch: it is impossible to live off the land in a city. To get food you need money. If you have no money, you can't buy food. Money can be earned, given - essentially a form of charity- or stolen.\n\nOur jobs crisis will push back parenthood even later...\n\nTo earn money, you generally need a job. Modern technological changes have the possibility to make billions of people unemployed, in a similar way that happened in the agricultural and industrial revolutions of the 1700s-1800s. At the time large scale unemployment and poverty to millions resulted. (see Page ). Many service jobs can either be outsourced to cheaper places - such as India - or be accomplished by computers which use better voice recognition and artificial intelligence (see P ). Many manufacturing jobs are already being outsourced to low cost countries - even China is getting expensive - and the few jobs that return are likely to be done by new, low cost robots (see P) or on or by 3D printers (see P). Even distribution jobs are at risk (see P _)\n\nA lack of food and money has historically delayed the age at which people got married. A delay in marriage reduced the number of children a couple would have. A shortage of money also encouraged intergenerational marriages: a man who was 10-20 years older than his bride had accumulated sufficient wealth to be able to afford a wife and subsequent children. With the ability to \"bank\" female fertility, same age couples may chose to delay having kids until their forties or fifties to ensure they have enough money to educate and provide for them, or we may see more older women marrying younger men, once the women have accumulated enough wealth to make it affordable to have kids.\n\nGay marriages, delayed marriages and delayed pregnancies all have one thing in common: a decline in the number of children per female of childbearing age. Many advanced countries are already seeing the average number of children per female dropping from the 'replacement' level of 2.1 to a 1.2-1.3 % range. These trends are likely to push the level of procreation down to an average lower than 1.0. Populations are still likely to expand for decades as those that are alive today remain alive for a longer lifespan, and the present population have additional children of their own. But at some point, in 3 -4 decades hence, we should expect a rapid decline of native populations as people start to die off.\n\n...resulting in another crisis.\n\nThis new crisis has some historical precedents: the plagues of the Roman empire in the 300s and 500s or the plagues that struck Asia and Europe in the 1300s. Between 30% and 50% of the population was wiped out during those periods, depending on the location. Countries that adopt large scale immigration policies to counter the loss of their native population will see a radical change in the ethnic, religious and social make up of their lands. Muslims immigrants will form the main immigrant population in Europe, and Hispanics and Asians in the US and Canada. Countries that do not accept large-scale immigration will be transformed socially anyway, with a very large population aged over 60 and increased levels of robotics.\n\nAll of this turmoil thanks to the invention of the Pill and the condom.\n\nWhy Is Bisexuality Becoming Mainstream?",

As a History Future Now piece, we will examine how the lessons of yesteryear can illuminate our understanding of the present and guide us through the uncharted territories of a world where living to 150 becomes the norm.\n\nOur exploration will commence with an in-depth look at the groundbreaking technologies propelling the longevity revolution forward, and the visionary minds at the forefront of this transformative movement. From there, we will embark on a thought-provoking analysis of the potential metamorphoses that a 150-year lifespan could trigger across the domains of work, education, family, and social structures, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities that may arise.\n\nAs we venture further into this uncharted territory, we will confront the profound psychological, philosophical, and environmental ramifications of radical longevity head-on. We will ponder what it truly means to be human in a world where life can span well over a century, and explore how we might uncover renewed meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in a landscape so dramatically altered.\n\nJoin us on this journey as we unravel the mysteries of radical life extension and paint a portrait of the future that awaits us.\n\nLet us begin.\n\nPart 1: The Longevity Revolution\n\nThe quest for longer lifespans is not a new phenomenon, but recent technological advancements have brought us closer to making this dream a reality. Today, a growing number of companies and researchers are dedicating their efforts to developing innovative solutions to extend human life and combat age-related diseases.\n\nOne of the most promising areas of research is gene therapy, which involves modifying or replacing faulty genes to treat or prevent diseases. Companies like Calico, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., and AgeX Therapeutics are exploring the potential of gene therapy to slow down the ageing process and extend healthspan, the period of life spent in good health.\n\nAnother key area of focus is stem cell research, which holds the potential to regenerate damaged tissues and organs. Companies such as Unity Biotechnology and Turn.bio are developing therapies that target senescent cells, which accumulate with age and contribute to age-related diseases. By removing these cells or reversing their effects, scientists hope to promote healthy ageing and extend lifespan.\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are also playing a crucial role in the longevity revolution. By analysing vast amounts of biological data, AI algorithms can help identify new drug targets, optimise treatment plans, and personalise medicine. Companies like Insilico Medicine and BenevolentAI are leveraging AI to accelerate the discovery and development of therapies for age-related diseases.\n\nNanotechnology is another field that holds promise for extending human lifespans. By engineering materials and devices at the nanoscale, scientists can create targeted drug delivery systems, advanced diagnostic tools, and regenerative therapies. Companies such as Oisín Biotechnologies and Leucadia Therapeutics are harnessing the power of nanotechnology to develop innovative solutions for combating age-related diseases.\n\nInterestingly, much of the funding for these cutting-edge longevity technologies comes from ageing tech billionaires who have a personal stake in the quest for longer lifespans. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, and Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, have invested millions of dollars into longevity research and start-ups. Their involvement highlights the growing interest and investment in the field of life extension.\n\nAs these technologies continue to advance and converge, we can expect to see significant progress in the coming years. However, the implications of a 150-year lifespan extend far beyond the realm of science and technology. In the following sections, we will explore how this longevity revolution could transform various aspects of our society, from work and education to family structures and social relationships.\n\nPart 2: The Transformation of Work and Education\n\nIn a society where people live and remain active for over a century, the traditional notion of a linear career path followed by retirement would become obsolete.\n\nInstead, we may see the emergence of a more fluid and dynamic approach to work, with individuals cycling through multiple careers and periods of learning throughout their lives. The concept of \"lifelong learning\" would take on new meaning as people continuously acquire new skills and knowledge to keep pace with technological advancements and shifting job markets.\n\nEducational institutions would need to adapt to this new reality, offering more flexible and modular programs that allow students to dip in and out of learning as needed. The distinction between \"traditional\" students and \"adult learners\" would blur, as people of all ages seek to upgrade their skills and pursue new passions.\n\nBut with longer lifespans comes the risk of widening inequalities. Those with access to education and resources may be better equipped to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing job market, while others may struggle to keep up. Policymakers and business leaders will need to grapple with these issues and develop strategies to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to thrive in this new age of longevity.\n\nLooking back in history, we can see how previous shifts in work and education have had far-reaching consequences for society. The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries transformed the nature of work, as machines replaced manual labor and new industries emerged. This led to profound changes in social structures, as people migrated from rural areas to cities in search of factory jobs.\n\nSimilarly, the rise of the knowledge economy in the late 20th century brought about a new emphasis on higher education and specialised skills. As we move deeper into the 21st century and the age of 150-year lifespans, we can expect to see even more dramatic transformations in the way we work and learn.\n\nPart 3: Redefining Family and Social Structures\n\nIn a world where multiple generations coexist for longer periods, the traditional nuclear family model may give way to more diverse and complex arrangements.\n\nWe may see the rise of multi-generational households, with grandparents and great-grandparents playing a more active role in child-rearing and family life. The concept of \"sandwich generations,\" where middle-aged adults care for both their children and their ageing parents, would become more pronounced, as people juggle the responsibilities of parenting and eldercare for longer periods.\n\nLonger lifespans could also lead to more fluid and dynamic social relationships. As people move through multiple careers and life stages, they may form new connections and social networks at different points in their lives. The idea of a \"lifelong best friend\" or a \"soulmate\" may become less relevant, as individuals adapt to changing circumstances and seek out new companions. This will have significant impacts on family dynamics. Children are likely to lose their significance as individuals may have multiple \"litters\" with different partners over several decades.\n\nBut with these new opportunities come new challenges. Longer lifespans could exacerbate existing inequalities, as those with greater resources and support networks are better able to navigate the complexities of multi-generational living and social change. Already we see significant health variation between richer and poorer members of our societies. The poor today have a greater tendency to be overweight and have lifestyle related health issues. Health choices mean that they may end up dying at half the age of richer people. The rich will have longer to become even richer. Policymakers and community leaders will need to address these disparities and work to create more inclusive and supportive social structures.\n\nHistory offers some insight into how societies have adapted to changing family and social dynamics in the past. The 20th century saw a significant shift towards smaller, nuclear families in many parts of the world, as people moved away from extended family structures and towards more independent living arrangements. This change was driven by a combination of economic, social, and cultural factors, including urbanisation, rising education levels, and changing gender roles.\n\nWe can expect to see even more profound shifts in the way we structure our families and social relationships in the years to come.\n\nPart 4: The Shifting Landscape of Health and Aging\n\nAs people live longer, the focus of healthcare would shift from treating acute illnesses to managing chronic conditions and promoting healthy ageing.\n\nWe can expect to see a greater emphasis on preventive medicine, as people seek to maintain their physical and cognitive function well into their later years. This could lead to the development of new therapies and interventions aimed at slowing or reversing the ageing process itself.\n\nBut with longer lifespans comes the risk of increased disability and frailty in old age. Even if we are able to extend life, there is no guarantee that those extra years will be spent in good health. This could place a significant burden on healthcare systems and families, as more people require long-term care and support.\n\nTo address these challenges, we will need to rethink our approach to ageing and elder care. This may involve developing new models of community-based care, where older adults can receive support and services in their own homes and neighbourhoods. It may also require a greater focus on promoting social engagement and purpose in later life, as research has shown that these factors are key to maintaining cognitive and physical function.\n\nPrevious shifts in health and ageing have had far-reaching consequences for society. The 20th century saw a dramatic increase in life expectancy, driven in large part by advances in public health and medical science. This led to the emergence of new social and economic institutions, such as social security systems and retirement communities, to support an ageing population.\n\nHow we manage the future shift will require collaboration across multiple sectors, including healthcare, social services, urban planning, and technology.\n\nPart 5: Adapting Institutions and Infrastructure\n\nMany of our current systems and structures were designed for a world where people lived for much shorter periods, and they may not be well-suited to the needs of a population that lives for over a century.\n\nFor example, our current social security and pension systems are based on the assumption that people will retire in their 60s and live for another decade or two. But in a world where people routinely live to 150, these systems may become unsustainable, as more people draw benefits for longer periods. Significantly longer retirement periods of 70-90 years seems unfeasible economically, which may mean that people will be forced to work for decades longer than they currently are expected to or they may simply opt to die earlier.\n\nSimilarly, our transportation and housing infrastructure may need to be adapted to meet the needs of an ageing population. This could involve developing new modes of transportation that are accessible and safe for older adults, as well as designing housing that can accommodate multiple generations living together.\n\nEducation and workforce development systems would also need to evolve to support lifelong learning and career transitions. As people move through multiple careers over the course of a 150-year lifespan, they will need access to ongoing education and training opportunities to stay competitive in the job market.\n\nWe can see how societies have adapted their institutions and infrastructure in response to changing demographics and social needs. The post-World War II era saw the rise of suburban development and the expansion of highway systems in the United States, as families moved away from cities and towards more spacious living arrangements. Similarly, the late 20th century saw the growth of the service economy and the rise of digital infrastructure, as the nature of work and communication shifted.\n\nWe will need to be proactive in adapting our institutions and infrastructure to meet the needs of an ageing population. This will require significant investment and innovation across multiple sectors, from transportation and housing to education and workforce development.\n\nPart 6: The Environmental Impact of Longevity\n\nPeople living longer will inevitably strain our planet's resources, as a larger population consumes more food, water, energy, and other necessities over an extended period.\n\nWe cannot underestimate the challenges posed by a growing and longer-living population. A 2019 United Nations report projects that the world's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, and if lifespans increase dramatically, this number could soar even higher. This population growth, combined with the increased resource consumption that accompanies longer lifespans, will likely exacerbate issues like climate change, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity.\n\nTo mitigate these potential impacts, we must develop and implement sustainable practices and technologies across all sectors of society. In the energy sector, this means rapidly transitioning towards renewable sources like nuclear, solar, wind, and hydro power, and developing more efficient energy storage systems. In agriculture, we must adopt sustainable practices such as vertical farming to reduce the environmental impact of food production while enhancing food security.\n\nDeveloping circular economies, where waste is minimized and resources are kept in use for as long as possible, will also be critical in a world of longer lifespans. This requires widespread adoption of recycling and upcycling technologies, as well as a shift towards more durable, repairable, and biodegradable products.\n\nHowever, the environmental implications of radical longevity raise complex ethical and philosophical questions that go beyond technology and innovation. We must ask ourselves: is it morally justifiable for some individuals to live for 150 years or more, consuming resources over such an extended period, while others struggle to meet their basic needs? How do we balance the rights and desires of current generations with the needs of future generations who will inherit the planet we leave behind?\n\nThese challenging questions require us to grapple with issues of equity, responsibility, and intergenerational justice. One approach is to view radical life extension as an opportunity to foster a greater sense of stewardship and long-term thinking. If people know they may live to see the consequences of their actions over a much longer time horizon, they may feel more motivated to make decisions that prioritize sustainability and the health of the planet.\n\nPart 7: The Psychological and Philosophical Implications of Longevity\n\nFinally, it is crucial to consider not only the practical implications but also the psychological and philosophical ramifications of such a dramatic extension of human life.\n\nOne potential consequence is that people may become more cautious and conservative in their decision-making, seeking to preserve their health and wealth over a much longer time horizon. With the prospect of living for over a century, people may be less willing to take risks or make bold choices, knowing that an early death could mean missing out on many decades of life. This could lead to a society that is more risk-averse and resistant to change, prioritizing stability and security over innovation and exploration.\n\nAt the same time, a longer lifespan could also encourage people to adopt a more long-term perspective, recognizing the importance of planning for the future and making decisions with a view to their impact over many decades or even centuries. This could lead to a greater emphasis on sustainable living, as people seek to preserve the planet and its resources not just for themselves but for future generations as well.\n\nHowever, the prospect of living for 150 years or more could also raise profound questions about the meaning and purpose of life. With so much time on their hands, people may struggle to find fulfillment and avoid boredom or despair. While many people today are frightened of dying and wish to live longer, there are others who find themselves tired of life and welcome the release that death brings. For those in the first group, increased longevity will be a blessing. For those in the second group it will be a curse. This future of longevity will also coincide with other innovations such as advanced Artificial Intelligence and humanoid robots. Some may choose to end their lives prematurely, feeling that they have already achieved all they set out to do and have nothing left to live for. Others may seek to reinvent themselves multiple times over the course of their long lives, pursuing new passions and experiences in an effort to stay engaged and motivated.\n\nUltimately, the impact of a 150-year lifespan on the human psyche and spirit will depend on how we as a society choose to adapt and evolve in response to this new reality. Will we use our extended lifetimes to pursue wisdom, compassion, and personal growth, or will we succumb to cynicism, apathy, or hedonism? Will we find new ways to create meaning and purpose in a world where traditional milestones and timelines no longer apply, or will we struggle to find our place in a radically transformed society?\n\nThese are questions that we will need to grapple with as we move towards a future of radically extended lifespans. It will require not only technological and scientific innovation but also a deep examination of our values, beliefs, and aspirations as a species. By engaging in this reflection and dialogue now, we can begin to lay the foundation for a future in which a 150-year lifespan is not just a possibility but an opportunity for greater wisdom, compassion, and flourishing.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe prospect of a 150-year lifespan represents a profound shift in the human experience, one that will transform every aspect of our lives and societies. From the cutting-edge technologies that are making this revolution possible to the social, economic, and environmental implications of a dramatically extended lifespan, the challenges and opportunities before us are vast and complex.\n\nAs we have seen, a world in which people routinely live to 150 or beyond will require us to fundamentally rethink our approaches to work, education, family, health, and aging. It will demand new models of social organization and support, as well as innovative solutions to the environmental and resource challenges posed by a growing and longer-living population.\n\nThe psychological and philosophical implications of radical longevity are just as profound. A 150-year lifespan will challenge us to find new sources of meaning and purpose, to cultivate resilience and adaptability in the face of change, and to grapple with deep questions about the nature of the human experience and our place in the world.\n\nThe future is going to be very interesting.",

The contrast could not have been starker: two of America's most storied newspapers, operating in the same market, at the same time -- one dying, the other thriving.\n\nThis article is not about the Washington Post's management failures, though they were significant. It is about something much bigger and much older. It is about a pattern that has repeated itself at least five times in the past 600 years: the emergence of a new information technology, the destruction of the institutions that controlled the old one, and the resulting upheaval in political power.\n\nHistory Future Now argues that the collapse of the institutional press is not a business story. It is a power story. Whoever controls the flow of information controls the distribution of power. When the technology that carries information changes, the institutions that depend on the old technology collapse, and the political order that those institutions sustained collapses with them. This has happened with the invention of the printing press, with cheap newspapers, with the telegraph, with radio and television, and it is happening now with the internet and artificial intelligence.\n\nEach transition produced a period of extraordinary chaos -- religious wars, revolutions, the rise of demagogues -- before new institutions emerged to stabilise the system. We are in one of those chaotic periods right now. Understanding the previous ones helps explain what is coming next.\n\nThe First Revolution: The Printing Press and the End of the Catholic Monopoly (1450-1648)\n\nBefore Gutenberg, information was controlled by the people who could afford to produce books by hand. In practice, that meant the Catholic Church. Monasteries were the libraries, schools, and publishing houses of medieval Europe. The Church decided what was written, what was copied, what was taught, and what was suppressed. This monopoly on information gave the Church extraordinary political power -- the power to crown kings, to excommunicate emperors, and to mobilise entire nations for crusades.\n\nThe printing press, introduced in Europe around 1450, destroyed this monopoly in a single generation. Books that had cost a year's wages for a skilled craftsman suddenly cost a few weeks' wages. By 1500, an estimated 20 million volumes had been printed in Europe. By 1600, it was 200 million. Information that had been confined to monasteries and royal courts flooded out into the hands of merchants, lawyers, minor nobility, and eventually ordinary literate citizens.\n\nThe political consequences were immediate and catastrophic. Martin Luther's 95 Theses, posted in 1517, would have remained a local academic dispute without the printing press. Instead, they were printed, translated, and distributed across Germany within weeks. Within months they had reached every corner of Europe. The Church, which had survived previous challenges to its authority by controlling the flow of information, found itself unable to suppress Luther's arguments. People could read them for themselves. The Reformation was, in a very real sense, the first viral information event.\n\nWhat followed was 130 years of religious warfare, political upheaval, and social chaos, culminating in the Thirty Years' War, which killed between 20% and 40% of Germany's population. The printing press had not caused these wars in the way that a bullet causes a wound. But it had destroyed the institution -- the Catholic Church's information monopoly -- that had maintained a certain kind of political order. The new technology empowered new voices, and those voices had very different ideas about how the world should be organised.\n\nIt took over a century for new institutions to emerge that could manage the information environment created by the printing press. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 established the modern state system, with its principles of sovereignty and non-interference. State-run censorship, licensing of printers, and eventually copyright law provided new frameworks for controlling the flow of information. The chaos subsided. But the Catholic Church never recovered its monopoly on information, and the political order it had sustained was gone for good.\n\nThe Second Revolution: Cheap Newspapers and Mass Democracy (1830-1900)\n\nFor the first 350 years after Gutenberg, the printing press remained expensive enough that publishing was the preserve of the wealthy, the educated, and the state. Books and pamphlets circulated among elites. Newspapers existed, but they were expensive, small-circulation affairs aimed at merchants, politicians, and the aristocracy.\n\nThis changed dramatically in the 1830s and 1840s with a series of technological innovations: the steam-powered rotary press, cheap wood-pulp paper, and eventually the Linotype machine. Together, these inventions reduced the cost of printing a newspaper by more than 90%. The \"penny press\" was born -- cheap, mass-circulation daily newspapers aimed not at elites but at ordinary working people.\n\nThe political consequences were transformative. Mass-circulation newspapers created, for the first time, a genuinely informed public. Citizens who had previously relied on word of mouth, sermons, and local gossip for their understanding of the world could now read daily accounts of what their government was doing. This transparency was uncomfortable for those in power. The term \"Fourth Estate\" -- the idea that the press served as an unofficial fourth branch of government, holding the other three to account -- emerged in this period. Thomas Carlyle attributed it to Edmund Burke, who supposedly said that \"there were Three Estates in Parliament; but, in the Reporters' Gallery yonder, there sat a Fourth Estate more important far than they all.\"\n\nCheap newspapers enabled mass democracy. Not because they were inherently democratic -- many were owned by wealthy individuals with their own political agendas -- but because they made it impossible for governments to operate in secret. A politician who took a bribe, a general who lost a battle through incompetence, a factory owner who poisoned his workers -- all of these could now be exposed to millions of readers within hours.\n\nBut cheap newspapers also enabled something else: mass manipulation. William Randolph Hearst's newspapers helped push the United States into the Spanish-American War in 1898. Lord Northcliffe's Daily Mail and Daily Mirror shaped British public opinion for decades. Newspaper proprietors discovered that they could manufacture consent, create panics, and destroy political careers. As the American journalist A.J. Liebling observed, \"freedom of the press belongs to those who own one.\"\n\nThe relationship between press power and political power was always complicated. Newspapers held governments to account, but they also served the interests of their owners. Still, the system worked reasonably well for over a century. Newspapers employed armies of reporters who covered every level of government, from parish councils to parliaments. They maintained foreign correspondents in every major capital. They investigated corruption, exposed scandals, and provided citizens with the information they needed to make informed decisions. For all their flaws, newspapers were the infrastructure of democratic accountability.\n\nThe Third Revolution: The Telegraph, Radio, and the Rise of Mass Propaganda (1840-1950)\n\nThe telegraph, introduced commercially in the 1840s, and radio, which became widespread in the 1920s, did not destroy newspapers. But they fundamentally changed the speed and reach of information, and in doing so they shifted the balance of power toward those who controlled these new technologies.\n\nThe telegraph allowed information to travel faster than any human being. Before the telegraph, news from distant events took days, weeks, or months to arrive. After the telegraph, it arrived in minutes. This dramatically increased the power of centralised news agencies -- Reuters, the Associated Press, Havas -- which could gather information from around the world and distribute it to newspapers everywhere. The telegraph also gave governments a new tool for controlling information. Telegraph lines could be tapped, censored, or cut.\n\nRadio was more revolutionary still. For the first time, a single voice could reach millions of people simultaneously, in their homes, without the intermediation of the printed word. This was a qualitative change, not just a quantitative one. The printed word requires literacy. It can be re-read, analysed, and argued with. Radio is immediate, emotional, and ephemeral. It appeals to feeling rather than reason.\n\nThe political implications were enormous. Franklin Roosevelt used radio masterfully with his \"fireside chats,\" speaking directly to the American people in a way that created an unprecedented bond between president and public. But the same technology also enabled the most effective propaganda machines in human history. Adolf Hitler understood radio's power instinctively. Joseph Goebbels made it the centrepiece of Nazi propaganda, ensuring that every German household had a cheap radio -- the Volksempfänger, or \"people's receiver\" -- that was designed to receive only German stations.\n\nRadio did not create fascism. But it gave authoritarian leaders a tool for mass manipulation that was qualitatively different from anything available through print. A newspaper editorial could be rebutted by another newspaper editorial. A radio broadcast entered the mind directly, and there was no equivalent mechanism for rebuttal. The listener was passive, the speaker all-powerful.\n\nTelevision extended radio's logic further. The Nixon-Kennedy debate of 1960 is often cited as the moment when television transformed politics -- those who listened on radio thought Nixon had won; those who watched on television thought Kennedy had won. The medium rewarded those who performed well on screen, regardless of the substance of what they were saying.\n\nBut here is the critical point: despite the arrival of telegraph, radio, and television, newspapers survived. More than survived -- they thrived. Television could broadcast events. But it could not investigate them. Radio could move people's emotions. But it could not hold the government to account through painstaking, multi-month investigations requiring teams of reporters, fact-checkers, and editors. Newspapers retained their role as the primary engine of democratic accountability even as they lost their monopoly on delivering news.\n\nThis is what many people fail to understand about the current crisis. When the Washington Post lays off half its newsroom, it is not the equivalent of a television network cancelling a show. It is the equivalent of shutting down the local police force. Nobody else is going to do the work that investigative reporters do. Television news relies heavily on newspaper reporting. Online news sites rely on newspaper reporting. Much of what people discuss on social media originated with a reporter at a newspaper who spent weeks or months uncovering the story.\n\nThe Fourth Revolution: The Internet and the Destruction of the Newspaper Business Model (1995-2026)\n\nTo understand why newspapers are dying, you need to understand how they made money. It was never really about selling news.\n\nFrom the mid-1800s until the early 2000s, newspapers were sustained by a business model so reliable that it was often described as a \"licence to print money.\" That model was classified advertising. If you wanted to sell a house, hire an employee, buy a car, or announce a death, you placed an advertisement in your local newspaper. The newspaper had a near-monopoly on this service because there was no alternative. Where else would you put a classified ad?\n\nDisplay advertising -- the large, branded advertisements from department stores, car companies, and consumer goods firms -- provided additional revenue. Together, classified and display advertising accounted for roughly 80% of newspaper revenue. Subscriptions and newsstand sales covered most of the rest. The journalism itself was essentially free -- it was the bait that attracted readers, who attracted advertisers, who paid the bills.\n\nThe internet destroyed this model in two stages.\n\nFirst, it destroyed classified advertising. Craigslist, launched in 1995, offered classified ads for free. eBay provided a marketplace for goods. Monster.com and later LinkedIn took over job listings. Rightmove and Zillow captured property listings. One by one, the revenue streams that had sustained newspapers for over a century were diverted to online platforms that did the same job faster, cheaper, and better. By 2020, US newspaper advertising revenue had fallen from $49 billion in 2006 to under $9 billion -- a decline of over 80% in just 14 years.\n\nSecond, the internet destroyed the geographic monopoly that had given newspapers their pricing power. In the print era, a reader in London could choose between a handful of national newspapers and their local paper. That was the entire market. The internet offered unlimited competition from everywhere, for free. Why would you pay for the local paper's foreign coverage when you could read the BBC, the Guardian, the New York Times, Al Jazeera, and a hundred other sources at no cost?\n\nThe results have been catastrophic. In the United States, newspaper employment has fallen from roughly 71,000 journalists in 2008 to around 30,000 today. Over 2,500 newspapers have closed since 2005, and more than half of all US counties now have either no local newspaper or only one -- creating what researchers call \"news deserts.\" In the United Kingdom, roughly 300 local newspapers have closed since 2009. In both countries, the trend is accelerating.\n\nThe consequences for democratic accountability are severe and, in many places, already measurable. Research has consistently shown that when local newspapers close, voter participation declines, municipal borrowing costs increase, corruption increases, and fewer people run for local office. This makes intuitive sense. If nobody is watching, why would the powerful behave? The entire edifice of democratic accountability rests on the assumption that someone is paying attention -- that misdeeds will be discovered, reported, and punished. Remove the reporter, and you remove the mechanism.\n\nThe Washington Post situation is particularly instructive because it shows that even a newspaper owned by one of the world's richest men is not immune. Jeff Bezos, with a net worth of roughly $260 billion, bought the Post in 2013 for $250 million -- loose change by his standards. The paper thrived initially, adding subscribers and digital capabilities. Then came a series of decisions that accelerated its decline: the abrupt cancellation of a presidential endorsement in late 2024 led hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel, and the installation of new management with a different editorial vision alienated more. But even without these self-inflicted wounds, the structural pressures -- declining advertising, unlimited competition, audience fragmentation -- were pushing the paper toward a reckoning.\n\nThe New York Times has, so far, bucked this trend. It has 12.8 million subscribers and is growing. But the Times is the exception that proves the rule. It has achieved this by transforming itself from a newspaper into a diversified digital media company -- adding cooking, games, sports, and lifestyle content alongside its journalism. It is, in effect, a subscription bundle that happens to include excellent news coverage. Most newspapers do not have the brand recognition, the resources, or the audience to replicate this strategy.\n\nThe Fifth Revolution: Artificial Intelligence and the End of the Information Middleman (2023-?)\n\nIf the internet destroyed the newspaper business model, artificial intelligence threatens to destroy the product itself.\n\nNewspapers -- and journalism more broadly -- have always been in the business of mediation. Reporters gather information. Editors select what is important. Fact-checkers verify claims. The finished product -- a news article -- is a curated, contextualised piece of information that tells the reader what happened, why it matters, and what might happen next. This mediation function is what distinguishes journalism from raw data.\n\nAI threatens to short-circuit this process. Large language models can already synthesise vast quantities of information, answer questions, summarise events, and generate plausible-sounding analysis. They do this at essentially zero marginal cost, instantaneously, and in response to individual user queries. Why would a reader go to the Washington Post to understand a trade policy when they can ask an AI to explain it in plain language, tailored to their level of knowledge, in seconds?\n\nThere are obvious problems with this model. AI systems can generate plausible but inaccurate information. They have no ability to conduct original reporting -- they cannot knock on doors, file freedom of information requests, cultivate sources, or sit through court proceedings. They depend entirely on information produced by others. If the journalists who produce that information lose their jobs, the AI has nothing to synthesise.\n\nBut this feedback loop may not save journalism. The market does not always behave rationally. If readers switch from paying for journalism to consuming AI-generated summaries of journalism, the economic model that supports original reporting collapses -- even though the AI depends on the reporting for its raw material. This is a classic tragedy of the commons: everyone benefits from journalism existing, but nobody wants to pay for it individually, and AI has made it possible to consume the benefits without paying the cost.\n\nThe early signs are already visible. AI-generated news summaries are appearing in search results, reducing click-through traffic to newspaper websites. AI chatbots are answering questions that readers would previously have searched for on news sites. Some estimates suggest that AI-driven search changes could reduce news website traffic by 25% to 40% over the coming years. For newspapers that are already struggling with declining advertising and subscriptions, this could be the killing blow.\n\nWhat Happens When Nobody Is Watching?\n\nEvery previous information revolution produced a period of chaos between the collapse of the old order and the establishment of a new one. The period between the printing press and the Peace of Westphalia was 200 years of religious wars. The period between cheap newspapers and the establishment of professional journalistic norms was marked by the \"yellow journalism\" era, in which newspapers routinely fabricated stories and manipulated public opinion to start wars.\n\nWe are in one of those transitional periods now. The old institutions of information -- newspapers, the broadcast networks, the professional press -- are collapsing. But no new institution has yet emerged to replace them.\n\nWhat has filled the vacuum, so far, is a combination of social media platforms, partisan news operations, newsletters, podcasts, and AI. None of these, individually or collectively, performs the accountability function that newspapers performed. Social media is good at amplifying information but terrible at verifying it. Partisan news operations serve their audience's existing beliefs rather than challenging them. Newsletters and podcasts can produce excellent analysis, but they lack the resources for sustained investigative reporting. AI, as discussed, depends on information produced by others.\n\nThe result is an information environment that is simultaneously more abundant and less reliable than at any point in human history. There is more information available to the average citizen than ever before. But the proportion of that information that has been verified, contextualised, and produced by someone with a professional obligation to accuracy has never been lower.\n\nThis has direct political consequences. When local newspapers close, corruption measurably increases. When national newspapers weaken, the ability of governments to operate without scrutiny expands. The politicians who benefit most from the collapse of the press are those who are least constrained by norms and most willing to lie -- because the institution whose job it was to call out lies is no longer strong enough to do so effectively.\n\nHistory teaches us that these transitional periods are dangerous. The chaos between the printing press and Westphalia produced the Thirty Years' War. The chaos between radio and the development of media regulation enabled fascist and communist propaganda machines. The current transitional period is already producing a measurable decline in democratic accountability, an increase in political polarisation, and a growing inability of citizens to distinguish verified information from fabrication.\n\nThe Question That Should Worry You\n\nHere is the question that should keep anyone who cares about self-governance awake at night, and it is a question that cuts across the usual political lines.\n\nIt is fashionable, particularly on the right, to celebrate the decline of legacy media. And there are legitimate reasons for dissatisfaction. Major newspapers have, over the past two decades, developed a marked progressive bias in their coverage that alienated a substantial portion of their readership. The New York Times' news pages became, at times, difficult to distinguish from its editorial pages. The Washington Post's motto, \"Democracy Dies in Darkness,\" came to feel ironic given its own editorial choices. Trust in media has declined for a reason, and that reason is not simply that the public became stupid.\n\nBut the alternative to biased institutional journalism is not unbiased journalism. The alternative, as we can already see, is no journalism -- at least not the kind that involves reporters spending six months investigating a corrupt government contract, or three years exposing a corporate fraud, or a decade tracking how public money is actually spent.\n\nThe question is: who does this work when the newspapers are gone?\n\nThe answer, so far, is: nobody.\n\nConservative politicians who celebrate the decline of the mainstream media should consider who will investigate the next local government corruption scandal, the next fraudulent defence contractor, or the next abuse of eminent domain. Progressive politicians who demand more \"responsible\" coverage should consider that the alternative to imperfect coverage is no coverage at all.\n\nThis is not a left-right issue. Accountability journalism protects citizens of all political persuasions from the abuse of power by people of all political persuasions. A conservative farmer whose land is being seized by a government agency needs a reporter just as much as a progressive whistleblower inside a corporation. When the reporters are gone, the powerful -- of whatever political stripe -- are free to do as they please.\n\nThe Precedent Nobody Wants To Think About\n\nHistory offers a precedent for what happens when the institutions that hold power to account are destroyed without replacement. It is not a comfortable one.\n\nIn the late Roman Republic, the system of checks and balances that had sustained Roman governance for centuries was gradually hollowed out. The Senate still existed. The law courts still functioned. The forms of the Republic were maintained. But the substance -- the genuine ability of these institutions to constrain the powerful -- had been eroded over generations. By the time of Julius Caesar, the Republic was a shell. The institutions that were supposed to prevent any one individual from accumulating too much power were too weak to do their job. The Republic did not fall in a single dramatic moment. It decayed, slowly, as the mechanisms of accountability lost their teeth one by one.\n\nThe Roman Republic did not have newspapers, obviously. But it had functional equivalents: the tribunes who represented the interests of the common people, the Senate's investigative powers, the public posting of laws and accounts, the tradition of public rhetoric in the Forum. When these mechanisms of transparency and accountability weakened, power concentrated. When power concentrated, the Republic ended.\n\nThe point is not that the fall of the Washington Post will lead to dictatorship. The point is that the institutions of accountability are fragile, that they can be destroyed faster than they can be built, and that once they are gone, the political consequences take decades to become fully apparent.\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\nEvery previous information revolution eventually produced a new institutional framework that restored a degree of order and accountability. The printing press eventually led to copyright law, licensing, and state regulation. Cheap newspapers led to professional journalistic standards, press freedom protections, and anti-monopoly regulation. Radio and television led to broadcast licensing, public service broadcasting, and the Fairness Doctrine.\n\nWhat will the internet and AI revolution produce?\n\nThere are some possibilities. Public service journalism, funded by taxation or endowments rather than advertising, could fill some of the gap -- the BBC model, essentially. Philanthropic funding for investigative journalism is growing, with organisations like ProPublica, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and the Marshall Project producing high-quality work. Some countries are experimenting with direct public subsidies for local journalism.\n\nTechnology itself may provide partial solutions. AI could, in theory, reduce the cost of certain journalistic tasks -- summarising court records, monitoring public spending, analysing corporate filings -- freeing human reporters to focus on the parts of journalism that require human judgment, relationships, and persistence. Blockchain-based verification systems could help authenticate original reporting and track its provenance.\n\nBut History Future Now would argue that none of these solutions, alone or together, will be sufficient without a fundamental recognition of what journalism actually is: not a market product, but a public good. Clean air, safe streets, and honest government are all public goods -- things that benefit everyone, that the market undersupplies, and that therefore require collective provision. Accountability journalism belongs in this category. It benefits everyone who lives under a government, regardless of whether they personally read a newspaper.\n\nThe question is whether democratic societies will recognise this before it is too late, or whether they will only understand what they have lost after the consequences have become irreversible.\n\nEvery previous information revolution produced decades of chaos before new institutions emerged. The printing press led to 130 years of religious war. The lesson is not that the chaos is inevitable. The lesson is that the chaos is the default -- and that escaping it requires deliberate, sustained institutional innovation.\n\nWe have about ten years before the current generation of accountability journalists -- the ones trained in the old system, with the institutional memory and the professional skills -- retires or is laid off for good. After that, the knowledge of how to investigate, verify, and hold power to account will be genuinely lost. It took centuries to build those institutions. It will take a single generation to destroy them.\n\nBut here is the detail that should make you stop scrolling and think.\n\nYou are reading this article on a website that contains no advertising. It was not produced by a newspaper. It was not funded by a billionaire. It was not generated by an algorithm optimising for your engagement. It exists because someone decided that long-form analysis of historical patterns matters enough to create for free.\n\nNow consider: where did the information in this article come from? The statistics on newspaper closures were gathered by researchers at Northwestern University -- funded by an endowment. The employment data came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- a government agency. The historical analysis draws on centuries of scholarship preserved in universities and libraries -- institutions maintained by public investment. The news about the Washington Post layoffs was reported by journalists at NPR, CNN, the New York Times, and Al Jazeera -- every one of them a news organisation that still employs reporters to sit in press conferences, make phone calls, and verify facts.\n\nPull on any thread of information in your daily life -- any fact you rely on to make decisions about your health, your finances, your community, your vote -- and at the other end of that thread, you will almost always find a journalist, a researcher, or a public servant who was paid to discover and verify that information. The entire information ecosystem that allows democratic societies to function depends on a surprisingly small number of people doing unglamorous, expensive, time-consuming work that the market increasingly refuses to fund.\n\nHere is a number that should haunt you: there are now more public relations professionals in the United States than there are journalists. The people paid to shape the narrative outnumber the people paid to discover the truth by roughly six to one. In 1980, the ratio was closer to one to one. Every year, the gap widens. Every year, more of what you read, hear, and see was created not to inform you, but to persuade you -- and the institutions that used to stand between the persuaders and the public are shrinking toward irrelevance.\n\nFebruary 4th 2026 -- the day a war correspondent learned she had been fired while sheltering from Russian drones -- was not the day journalism died. Journalism is dying the way Hemingway described going bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly.\n\nThe canary has stopped singing. The question now is what you do about the air in the mine.\n\nHistory Is Written By The Winners. And Europeans Are Losing.",

This is rather like being called a flat-earther for noting that gravity exists.\n\nThis article examines how civilisations across five millennia approached the movement of peoples, what happened when they got it wrong, and what the data tells us about where the West's current experiment is heading.\n\nThe Ancient Default: Walls, Laws, and Suspicion\n\nThe historical norm is not merely border control. It is active hostility to uncontrolled migration. This was not irrational prejudice. It was survival.\n\nSumer and Egypt: The First Border States\n\nThe earliest civilisations for which we have records -- Sumer, Egypt, Akkad -- all maintained strict distinctions between citizens and foreigners. The Sumerian city-states (c. 3500-2000 BC) had specific legal categories for non-citizens, who were barred from owning land, holding office, or participating in religious rites (Kramer, 1963). Egypt's Middle Kingdom (c. 2055-1650 BC) maintained a network of fortresses along the Nubian border specifically to control the movement of peoples. The Semna Dispatches, administrative documents from these border posts, record the meticulous tracking of every foreigner who crossed -- their name, origin, purpose, and expected departure date (Spalinger, 2005).\n\nThis was not xenophobia in the modern sense. It was statecraft. These civilisations understood something that modern policymakers have chosen to forget: that the character of a state is determined by the character of its people, and that changing the people changes the state.\n\nAthens: Democracy for Athenians Only\n\nAthens, the civilisation most often invoked as the ancestor of Western liberal values, had immigration policies that would make a modern populist blush. Under Pericles' citizenship law of 451 BC, only those born to two Athenian parents could be citizens (Hansen, 1991). Foreigners who lived and worked in Athens -- the metics -- paid a special tax, could not own land, could not vote, could not hold office, and could not marry Athenian citizens without special dispensation. Aristotle, who lived in Athens for most of his adult life, was a metic. So was Hippocrates.\n\nThe Athenians did not consider this unjust. They considered it obvious. Citizenship was not a right conferred by geography. It was an inheritance conferred by blood and culture. The polis was not a service provider. It was a community of shared identity, shared gods, and shared obligations.\n\nChina: The Wall as National Philosophy\n\nChina's approach to immigration is perhaps the most instructive, because it was the most sustained and the most successful. From the Qin Dynasty's first unification of the northern walls (c. 221 BC) through the Ming Dynasty's massive reconstruction (1368-1644), the Great Wall was not merely a military fortification. It was a philosophical statement: civilisation ends here. Beyond this line are barbarians (Waldron, 1990).\n\nThe Chinese did not build the Wall because they were ignorant of the peoples beyond it. They built it because they knew them intimately. The steppe nomads -- Xiongnu, Turkic, Mongol -- were militarily formidable, culturally alien, and, when admitted in large numbers, politically destabilising. The periods when the Wall was neglected or the borders were porous -- the late Han, the late Tang, the late Song -- were precisely the periods when China was conquered or fragmented by peoples from beyond it (Barfield, 1989).\n\nThe lesson was not lost on subsequent dynasties. The Ming, having expelled the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, rebuilt the Wall with a thoroughness that bordered on obsession. They were not building against a specific threat. They were building against the principle of uncontrolled entry.\n\nJapan: The Closed Country\n\nJapan's sakoku policy (1633-1853) represents the most extreme version of immigration control in recorded history. For over two hundred years, no foreigner could enter Japan and no Japanese could leave, on pain of death. Foreign trade was restricted to a single artificial island in Nagasaki harbour, where a handful of Dutch merchants were permitted to operate under suffocating restrictions (Toby, 1984).\n\nThe result was not stagnation. It was one of the most remarkable periods of cultural flowering in Japanese history. The Edo period produced kabuki, ukiyo-e, haiku, the tea ceremony in its mature form, and a level of urban sophistication that astonished the first Western visitors when the country was forcibly opened in the 1850s. Japan's population was literate, healthy, and culturally cohesive to a degree unmatched anywhere in the contemporary world (Jansen, 2000).\n\nThe sakoku policy was extreme. But it demonstrated something important: a society that controls its borders controls its destiny. Japan emerged from two centuries of isolation as the most culturally unified nation on earth, and within fifty years of opening had industrialised faster than any country in history.\n\nRome: The Cautionary Tale\n\nNo civilisation's experience with immigration is more relevant to the modern West than Rome's, because no civilisation's trajectory more closely mirrors our own.\n\nThe Early Republic: Citizenship as Fortress\n\nEarly Rome was ferociously exclusive. Citizenship was restricted to freeborn Romans. The ius civitatis -- the right of citizenship -- was the most jealously guarded privilege in the ancient world. It conferred legal protections, voting rights, access to public land, and exemption from certain taxes and punishments. It could not be bought. It could only be inherited or, in rare cases, granted by the Senate for extraordinary service (Sherwin-White, 1973).\n\nRome's Italian allies fought a war -- the Social War of 91-88 BC -- specifically to obtain Roman citizenship. The fact that they had to fight a war to get it tells you everything about how Rome valued it.\n\nThe Turning Point: Universal Citizenship\n\nIn AD 212, the Emperor Caracalla issued the Constitutio Antoniniana, granting Roman citizenship to virtually all free inhabitants of the empire. The stated reason was administrative convenience and tax revenue. The actual effect was to render citizenship meaningless. If everyone is a citizen, no one is (Ando, 2012).\n\nWithin two generations, the Roman army was predominantly staffed by Germanic foederati -- barbarian soldiers serving under their own commanders, loyal to their own chiefs, fighting for Roman pay but not for Roman identity. By the fifth century, the distinction between Roman and barbarian had become so blurred that the \"fall\" of Rome in 476 was less a conquest than a change of management. Odoacer, the Germanic chieftain who deposed the last Western emperor, had been a Roman general (Heather, 2006).\n\nThe parallel with modern Western citizenship -- increasingly detached from cultural identity, increasingly a matter of paperwork rather than belonging -- is uncomfortable and precise.\n\nThe Modern Anomaly: How the West Opened Its Gates\n\nThe current Western approach to immigration is not the product of centuries of liberal evolution. It is the product of a single generation's policy decisions, made between approximately 1948 and 1975, and it reversed millennia of practice.\n\nThe United States: From Restriction to Revolution\n\nThe United States, often presented as a \"nation of immigrants,\" was for most of its history a nation of selected immigrants. The Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted citizenship to \"free white persons of good character.\" The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned Chinese immigration entirely. The Immigration Act of 1924 established national-origin quotas designed to preserve the existing ethnic composition of the country -- overwhelmingly Northern European (Daniels, 2004).\n\nThis changed with the Hart-Celler Act of 1965, which abolished national-origin quotas and replaced them with a system based on family reunification and skills. The Act's sponsors explicitly promised it would not change the ethnic composition of the country. Senator Ted Kennedy declared: \"The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society.\" He was wrong on both counts. The foreign-born share of the US population has risen from 4.7% in 1970 to over 14% today -- the highest level in over a century (Migration Policy Institute, 2024).\n\nEurope: The Post-War Labour Bargain\n\nEurope's transformation was different in mechanism but identical in outcome. Post-war labour shortages led to Gastarbeiter programmes in Germany, Commonwealth immigration in Britain, and North African recruitment in France. These were explicitly temporary arrangements. The workers were supposed to come, work, and go home.\n\nThey did not go home.\n\nGermany's Turkish Gastarbeiter population, recruited from the 1960s, has grown to over three million. Britain's Commonwealth immigration, initially from the Caribbean and later from South Asia, has transformed the demographics of every major English city. France's North African population, concentrated in the banlieues, has created what the French themselves call \"territories lost to the Republic\" (Caldwell, 2009).\n\nIn every case, the pattern is the same: temporary labour migration became permanent settlement, which became family reunification, which became community formation, which became a demographic and political fact that no government could reverse without measures no democracy would tolerate.\n\nPublic Opinion: The Gap That Never Closes\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of Western immigration policy is the persistent gap between what governments do and what citizens want. This is not a recent phenomenon. It has been a constant for over fifty years.\n\nIn Britain, every major survey since the 1960s has shown that a majority of the public wants immigration reduced. Ipsos MORI's long-running tracker shows that immigration has been named as one of the top issues facing the country in every survey since 2001, and \"too much immigration\" has been the majority view for as long as the question has been asked (Ipsos, 2024). The 2016 Brexit vote was, at its core, a vote about immigration -- and it was won by the side that promised to reduce it.\n\nIn the United States, Gallup polling shows that the percentage of Americans who want immigration decreased has exceeded those who want it increased in every year since 1965 -- the very year the Hart-Celler Act was passed. As of 2024, 55% of Americans want immigration reduced, versus 16% who want it increased (Gallup, 2024).\n\nIn Germany, the Willkommenskultur of 2015 evaporated within months. By 2016, Merkel's approval ratings had collapsed, and the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) had become the country's third-largest party. By 2024, it was polling as the second-largest (Infratest dimap, 2024).\n\nThe pattern is universal across the Western world: governments pursue high immigration; publics oppose it; governments ignore the opposition; populist parties emerge; mainstream parties belatedly adopt restrictionist rhetoric while changing little in practice.\n\nWhat the Data Shows: Integration, Fiscal Impact, and Social Trust\n\nThe debate about immigration is often conducted in moral terms -- compassion versus cruelty, openness versus bigotry. But the data tells a more complicated story.\n\nThe Integration Problem\n\nThe assumption underlying Western immigration policy is that immigrants will integrate -- adopt the language, values, and civic habits of the host society within a generation or two. For some groups, this has been broadly true. East Asian immigrants to the United States, for example, outperform the native-born population on virtually every measure within a single generation (Pew Research Center, 2024).\n\nFor other groups, the picture is starkly different. In France, third-generation North African immigrants still have unemployment rates roughly double the national average. In Sweden, immigrants from Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq have employment rates below 40% after ten years of residence. In Germany, Turkish-origin residents in the third generation still show significant gaps in educational attainment and labour-force participation (OECD, 2023).\n\nThese are not failures of individual effort. They are structural patterns that persist across generations, and they suggest that the assumption of automatic integration is, for certain origin-destination combinations, simply wrong.\n\nThe Fiscal Equation\n\nThe fiscal impact of immigration is the question that most Western governments would prefer not to answer honestly. The evidence, when disaggregated by origin, is uncomfortable.\n\nA comprehensive study by the Danish Ministry of Finance (2018) found that immigrants from non-Western countries represented a net fiscal cost of approximately 33 billion Danish kroner per year, while immigrants from Western countries were net fiscal contributors. A similar analysis by the Dutch Central Planning Bureau (2003) found that the average non-Western immigrant represented a net lifetime fiscal cost of approximately EUR 43,000. The UK's Migration Advisory Committee (2018) found that EEA migrants were net fiscal contributors, while non-EEA migrants were net fiscal costs.\n\nThe pattern is consistent: immigration from culturally and economically similar countries tends to be fiscally positive; immigration from dissimilar countries tends to be fiscally negative. This is not a moral judgement. It is an accounting fact.\n\nThe Social Trust Problem\n\nPerhaps the most consequential finding in the immigration literature is Robert Putnam's discovery that ethnic diversity reduces social trust -- not just between groups, but within groups. In diverse communities, people of all ethnicities trust their neighbours less, participate less in civic life, and report lower life satisfaction (Putnam, 2007).\n\nPutnam, a liberal academic who spent years trying to find a way to present his findings positively, eventually concluded that diversity's negative effects on social cohesion were real, significant, and not easily remedied by policy interventions. His finding has been replicated across multiple countries and contexts (Dinesen & Sønderskov, 2015; Schaeffer, 2014).\n\nThis does not mean diversity is always bad. It means that rapid, large-scale demographic change imposes real costs on social cohesion that policymakers have consistently refused to acknowledge.\n\nThe Future: Three Scenarios\n\nWhere does the West's immigration experiment go from here? The historical record and current data suggest three possible trajectories.\n\nScenario 1: The Roman Path\n\nThe West continues its current trajectory. Immigration remains high. Integration remains partial. Cultural cohesion continues to erode. Political systems become increasingly polarised between cosmopolitan elites who benefit from immigration and native working classes who bear its costs. Eventually, the concept of national identity becomes so diluted that the nation-state itself loses legitimacy. This is, in essence, what happened to Rome between the third and fifth centuries.\n\nScenario 2: The Japanese Correction\n\nPublic pressure forces a dramatic policy reversal. Immigration is sharply curtailed. Nations invest heavily in automation, robotics, and AI to address labour shortages without demographic change. Birth rates are addressed through aggressive pro-natalist policies. This is broadly the path Japan has chosen, and while it carries its own risks -- an ageing population, labour shortages, fiscal strain -- it preserves social cohesion and national identity.\n\nScenario 3: The Singapore Model\n\nImmigration continues but is radically restructured. Entry is based strictly on economic contribution and cultural compatibility. Permanent residency and citizenship are difficult to obtain and easy to lose. There is no right to family reunification. There is no path from asylum to settlement. Immigration becomes a tool of national strategy rather than a moral obligation. This is essentially the model used by Singapore, the Gulf states, and, historically, by every successful civilisation before 1965.\n\nThe historical evidence overwhelmingly favours Scenarios 2 and 3. No civilisation that pursued Scenario 1 survived the consequences.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe West's current approach to immigration is not progressive. It is not enlightened. It is not the culmination of centuries of moral progress. It is a fifty-year-old experiment with no historical precedent and, so far, no historical support.\n\nEvery civilisation that lasted -- Egypt, China, Japan, the Roman Republic -- controlled its borders with care. Every civilisation that stopped -- the late Roman Empire, the late Ottoman Empire -- paid the price in fragmentation, loss of identity, and eventual collapse.\n\nThe question is not whether the West will change its immigration policies. The question is whether it will change them by choice, through democratic deliberation and strategic planning, or by force, through the kind of social and political crises that have accompanied every previous failure to manage the movement of peoples.\n\nHistory suggests the answer, but it does not compel it. The gates are still in our hands. The question is whether we have the will to use them.\n\nReferences\n\nAndo, C. (2012). Imperial Rome AD 193 to 284: The Critical Century.

What you are about to read is the story of the most consequential change in human civilisation since the Industrial Revolution, and almost nobody in power is willing to talk honestly about where it leads. Because where it leads is uncomfortable for everyone: left, right, rich, poor, East and West alike.\n\nThe numbers are clear. The history is unambiguous. The solutions on offer do not work. And the clock is already at zero.\n\nThe Scale of the Collapse\n\nFor a population to sustain itself, women need to have, on average, 2.1 children. That number is not political. It is arithmetic. One child to replace the mother, one to replace the father, and a fraction to account for those who die before reproducing. Fall below 2.1, and your population shrinks. Fall well below it, and your population does not just shrink. It disappears.\n\nLook at the chart below and ask yourself: how many of these countries have a future?\n\nThe speed of this decline is perhaps more alarming than the current levels. In 1960, South Korea had a fertility rate of 6.0 children per woman. Today it is 0.72. China went from 5.76 to 1.02. These are not gradual transitions. They are demographic cliff edges.\n\nEven within Europe, the picture is uniformly bleak. Not a single European country is at replacement level. France, long held up as the continent's fertility champion thanks to generous family policies, has dropped to 1.68 and falling. The Mediterranean countries are in freefall. Eastern Europe is emptying out through a combination of low births and emigration.\n\nAugustus's Problem: Why People Stop Having Children\n\nThis is not the first time a great civilisation has confronted a fertility crisis. In 18 BC, the Roman Emperor Augustus was so alarmed by the declining birth rate among Roman citizens that he passed the Lex Julia de Maritandis Ordinibus, a sweeping package of marriage and fertility laws. Unmarried citizens were penalised. Those with three or more children received tax breaks and preferential access to public office. Adultery was criminalised. Augustus understood that Rome's legions, its tax base, and its very identity depended on Romans actually producing the next generation.\n\nThe laws failed. Roman citizens continued to have fewer children. The empire increasingly relied on Germanic foederati to fill its military ranks and on slaves to do its work. Within four centuries, those same Germanic peoples would rule what had been Roman territory. The parallel with modern immigration policy is uncomfortably exact.\n\nWhy did Romans stop having children? For many of the same reasons that modern Westerners have. The costs rose. The benefits fell. Alternative lifestyles became available. And the culture shifted to prize individual fulfilment over familial duty.\n\nToday, the economics of having children in the modern West are brutal. Since 2000, the three things most essential to raising a child, hospital services, education, and childcare, have all risen dramatically faster than wages.\n\nThis is compounded by the sharp rise in the age at first marriage. In England and Wales, the average age at first marriage has risen from 21 for women in the 1960s to over 30 today. For men, it is now 32. Each year of delay reduces the window for having multiple children. A woman who marries at 32 and wants to space children two years apart will struggle to have more than two, even if she wants more.\n\nThe separation of sex from procreation, as this site has explored in earlier articles, removed the automatic link between desire and reproduction. Contraception gave women control over their fertility. But it also gave societies a way to stop reproducing without anyone noticing until it was too late. The decision not to have a child is private, invisible, and cumulative. By the time the aggregate effect shows up in the statistics, the damage is done.\n\nThe Immigration Fallacy: Why It Makes Things Worse, Not Better\n\nThe standard policy response to falling birth rates has been immigration. The argument is straightforward: if your own citizens will not have enough children to sustain the tax base, the workforce, and the pension system, import people from countries that still do. This has been the de facto policy of virtually every Western government for the past three decades.\n\nThere are two fundamental problems with this approach. The first is that it does not work for long. The second is that it actively makes the fiscal situation worse.\n\nThe Convergence Trap\n\nImmigrants do initially have higher fertility rates than the native population. But this advantage evaporates with remarkable speed. Data from France, which has tracked immigrant fertility more carefully than almost any other country, shows that immigrant fertility converges toward native-born rates within a single generation. Women from the Maghreb who arrived with fertility rates above 4.5 saw their daughters and granddaughters reproduce at rates barely above the French average.\n\nThis means immigration is not a solution to demographic decline. It is a treadmill. Each generation of immigrants must be replaced by a new, larger wave, because the previous wave has adopted the same low-fertility behaviour as the native population. The underlying problem, a culture and economy hostile to large families, remains unaddressed.\n\nThe Fiscal Drain\n\nThe second problem is more politically explosive, and it is one that most Western governments have been reluctant to examine honestly. In many cases, immigration does not generate the net fiscal benefit that proponents claim. In fact, the evidence suggests that for many immigrant groups, the fiscal cost to the host country exceeds the economic value they contribute.\n\nFinland provides some of the most rigorous data available. A 2019 study by Suomen Perusta, using age-standardised figures that account for the younger average age of immigrant populations, found that every single immigrant group represented a net fiscal cost compared to the native Finnish population. Immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa cost the Finnish state approximately EUR 19,500 per person more than they contributed. Even immigrants from Western countries, the most economically integrated group, still represented a net cost of approximately EUR 2,500 per person.\n\nThe picture in the United States tells a similar story. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau, analysed by the Center for Immigration Studies, shows that immigrant-headed households use welfare programs at significantly higher rates than native-born households. 52% of legal immigrant households and 59% of illegal-headed households use at least one welfare program, compared to 39% of U.S.-born households. The gap is largest in food assistance (SNAP) and Medicaid.\n\nThis does not mean that all immigration is economically negative, or that immigrants do not contribute in ways that are not captured by fiscal statistics. But it does mean that the argument most frequently advanced for mass immigration, that it is necessary to support the welfare state and the tax base, is at best incomplete and at worst the opposite of the truth. If the immigrants arriving cost more than they contribute, then immigration is not plugging the demographic hole. It is making it deeper.\n\nThe Gerontocracy: How Demographic Decline Reshapes Politics\n\nA society that stops having children does not just face economic problems. It faces a political transformation. When the old outnumber the young, democracies begin to reflect the interests of the elderly at the expense of the future.\n\nThis is already visible in the age profile of political leadership. In the United States, the percentage of Congress members over the age of 70 has tripled since the early 2000s, rising from around 8% to 23%. This is not because older people have suddenly become better politicians. It is because older voters dominate the electorate, and they elect people who look like them and share their priorities.\n\nThe consequences ripple outward. Housing policy favours existing homeowners over young renters. Education spending is deprioritised relative to healthcare and pensions. Long-term infrastructure investment, which benefits the young, loses out to short-term transfers that benefit the old. The political incentive structure of an ageing democracy is fundamentally hostile to the future.\n\nAcross Europe, this dynamic is playing out through the rise of populist parties that channel demographic anxiety into anti-immigration sentiment. The surge of the AfD in Germany, the collapse of the Conservatives in Britain, and the polarisation of American politics are all partly expressions of an ageing electorate that feels its world disappearing. These voters are not irrational. They are responding to a genuine structural shift. But the political responses on offer, whether from the populist right or the liberal left, are inadequate to the scale of the problem.\n\nThe Coming Burden: Who Will Pay?\n\nThe most immediate and measurable consequence of the fertility collapse is the old-age dependency ratio: the number of people aged 65 and over for every 100 people of working age. This ratio determines, more than almost any other number, whether pension systems remain solvent, whether healthcare can be funded, and whether economies can grow.\n\nThe projections are alarming. Japan, already the oldest large society in human history, will see its dependency ratio reach 70 by 2050, meaning 70 retirees for every 100 working-age adults. The EU will reach 55. China, whose one-child policy accelerated its demographic transition by decades, faces a particularly brutal trajectory: from a dependency ratio of 17 in 2020 to a projected 47 by 2050.\n\nThese numbers imply either massive increases in taxation on a shrinking workforce, massive cuts to pension and healthcare benefits for the elderly, massive increases in the retirement age, or some combination of all three. Every option is politically toxic. No democratic government has yet found a way to tell its citizens that the promises made to them, work hard, pay your taxes, and the state will look after you in old age, can no longer be kept.\n\nThe Long View: What History Teaches Us\n\nThe Roman parallel is instructive but incomplete. Rome's demographic decline was gradual, unfolding over centuries, and was partly masked by the empire's sheer territorial scale. The modern fertility collapse is happening at a speed without historical precedent. South Korea went from above-replacement fertility to the lowest rate ever recorded by a nation-state in less than forty years.\n\nA more apt comparison might be the demographic collapses that accompanied civilisational decline in other contexts. The Maya civilisation experienced a rapid depopulation in the ninth century that contributed to the abandonment of their great cities. The Black Death of the fourteenth century killed a third of Europe's population and fundamentally restructured its economy, its labour relations, and its social hierarchy. In both cases, the demographic shock was the proximate cause of changes that transformed every aspect of society.\n\nThe difference is that those collapses were involuntary. Ours is, in a sense, chosen. We have collectively, through millions of individual decisions, decided not to replace ourselves. The question is whether this represents a rational adaptation to modern conditions, a temporary cultural phase that will eventually correct itself, or the early stages of a civilisational decline that future historians will study with the same detachment with which we study Rome.\n\nYour Children Will Live in a Different World. If You Have Any.\n\nHere is an exercise. Think of your parents. Think of how many siblings they had. Now think of how many siblings you have. Now think of how many children you have, or plan to have.\n\nIf you are like most people reading this, the number has gone down with each generation. Your grandparents might have had four or five brothers and sisters. Your parents, two or three. You, one or none. Your children, if they exist, will grow up in a world where the friend with a sibling is the exception, not the rule. Where the concept of a cousin is something you explain rather than something you experience. Where the dependency ratio means that their wages will be taxed at rates we would consider confiscatory, to pay for a generation of retirees who outnumber them and who vote.\n\nEvery major challenge facing the Western world today, the sustainability of the welfare state, the integration of immigrants, the rise of populist politics, the shift in global power toward Asia, the housing crisis, the crisis of meaning among the young, connects back, in one way or another, to the simple fact that we are not having enough children.\n\nAnd yet the political discourse treats each of these as a separate problem requiring a separate solution. Immigration policy is debated without reference to fertility. Pension reform is discussed without acknowledging that the worker-to-retiree ratio is collapsing. Housing policy ignores the demographic structure of demand. Education spending is cut to fund elderly care. The connections are there for anyone willing to look, but looking requires confronting a reality that is deeply uncomfortable for both the political left and the political right.\n\nFor the left, it requires admitting that mass immigration, far from being a humanitarian good that also happens to be economically beneficial, is in many cases a net fiscal cost that deepens rather than solves the demographic crisis. The data from Finland and the United States is not ambiguous. The treadmill does not work. The hole gets deeper with each turn.\n\nFor the right, it requires admitting that market forces alone will not produce enough children, and that the traditional family structures they champion have been hollowed out by the very economic system they defend. You cannot celebrate deregulated housing markets and then wonder why young people cannot afford a home large enough for a family. You cannot applaud the gig economy and then be puzzled that people delay marriage and children.\n\nAugustus tried to legislate his way out of Rome's fertility crisis. He failed. Modern governments have tried to subsidise their way out with baby bonuses, parental leave, and tax credits. Hungary, which has implemented the most aggressive pro-natalist policies in Europe, has managed to nudge its fertility rate from 1.23 to 1.50. Heroic effort. Still half a child short of survival.\n\nNobody knows how to reverse a fertility decline once a society has passed below a certain threshold. That is not a political opinion. It is an empirical observation. No country in human history has recovered from a sustained rate below 1.5. The forces that drive the decline, urbanisation, education, contraception, female workforce participation, the cost of housing and childcare, the cultural elevation of individual fulfilment over familial obligation, are not easily reversible. They are, in many cases, things we call progress.\n\nSo let us be honest about where we stand. We are living through the opening act of the most profound demographic transformation in human history. It is slower than a war, quieter than a pandemic, and more consequential than either. It will determine which civilisations thrive in the twenty-second century and which are studied as historical curiosities. It will reshape the global balance of power more decisively than any army or technology. And it is already too late to stop it. The children who would have changed the trajectory were never born. That is the thing about demographic decline: by the time you notice it, the decision was made a generation ago.\n\nThat Italian classroom is still empty. The clock on the wall is still ticking.\n\nBut for whom?\n\nThe Demographic Time Bomb",

We look at 12 main forces, split into two parts, first what we refer to as \"inevitable history\" and second what we refer to as \"broken history\".\n\nInevitable history is easier to predict and we look at forces that are essentially a foregone conclusion; they were ongoing prior to the Covid 19 outbreak and Covid 19 has strengthened those forces, making them even more inevitable. Broken history is harder to predict. These are forces that would have happened had Covid 19 not emerged or forces that are unlikely to have occurred in the absence of Covid 19.\n\nAt the end of this article we pull all the forces together to create a picture of how the world will look like post Covid 19.\n\nInevitable History\n\nThere are a number of forces that Covid 19 is strengthening. They include some obvious ones like the rise of the digital world, the reduction in relevance of physical locations and the rise of the Far East. Some are less obvious, such as the increased value of human life, the creation of a global culture and the decline of military conflict. What is important to note is that many of these forces are self reinforcing, making it more likely that all of them will occur.\n\nSocieties are becoming more digital. The internet boom in the 2000s and the smartphone boom since 2006 pushed societies to become increasingly digital with dozens of physical items, such as maps, phones, board games, books, CDs, DVDs, being replaced by digital equivalents. It was always anticipated that more things would be purchased online and, as social distancing has forced societies to retreat inside, the digital world has expanded significantly faster than would have happened normally.\n\nInternet shopping for items as basic as groceries has increased sharply as families have replaced their weekly trip to the supermarket with weekly internet deliveries. Amazon.com is an essential service to millions, providing access to a world of products that are currently out of reach from physical stores.\n\nThe entertainment industry has been digital for decades, starting with music and then videos. The Covid 19 pandemic has accelerated this trend, with more people signing up to services like Netflix and Disney+. Venues that could once hold hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of people, such as theatres and sports stadia, stand empty as film distributors release movies direct to streaming platforms, theatres stream plays live and football matches are played in silence.\n\nEducation, which has had a range of online service providers struggling to find a market, is also going online as primary, secondary and university students are taught their core subjects at home. Cambridge University announced that all of its tuition for the 2020-2021 academic year will be done online and that residence in Cambridge would not be necessary. The cost of education will also be questioned. It is hard to justify a $250,000 bill from Harvard Online, and the concept of what is good enough for a degree will change as more people switch to lower cost online university specialists, such as the University of Phoenix. This has global implications.\n\nThis acceleration is likely to continue and to become permanent, resulting in a significant change in the physical landscape of our towns and cities, as shops and public venues close.\n\nThe rise of the digital world is not just about more things going on line. It is also accompanied by the fall in the relevance of geographic location. The first humans lived in small extended family groups. They lived this way for hundreds of thousands of years, following the seasons in a nomadic search for food. Farming brought settlement and the end to their nomadic existence. Extended families expanded into villages, towns, cities, countries and civilisations. Where you happened to be born would dictate if you were a citizen of a rich and powerful country or a poor and weak one.\n\nPeople today benefit from the work of others in two different physical forms. First, there is the work done in country by people who live in the country as well. These workers may be natives or immigrants. Second, there is work done by people who live outside the country. These workers might work in a factory that produces something that is imported into your country or might provide a service that you benefit from. A factory worker in China or a call centre operative in India would be two good examples.\n\nCovid 19 has accelerated the rollout of work that could be done remotely, either by fellow citizens working from home or foreigners working from their homes. Millions of white collar workers in the West have been working from home over the last few months. To the surprise of both employers and employees, it is clear that a large amount of their work can be done effectively, without ever having to go into the office. Both employers and employees will have strong drivers to maintain the status quo, even after Covid 19 has been tamed. Many employees like the flexibility of working from home and the fact that they no longer need to commute. This saves time and money. Equally, many employers are realising that they could save a lot of money on office space by encouraging certain people to work from home.\n\nBut once you accept the fact that it is possible to work from home, where your home is located becomes less important than an overlapping time zone and a good internet connection. Many people living in cities or commuting into cities will move further away. This is a good thing as it will spread jobs more widely throughout the country and will reduce congestion on roads and public transport.\n\nThe next logical step, however, will benefit companies and negativity impact citizens of higher income countries. Once people start working remotely there is limited practical difference if an employee works in London, from a remote Austrian village or from a suburb of Bangalore, so long as the employee has all the right skills for the job. When they appear on a Zoom call, distance has become irrelevant. But the cost of hiring each employee will be radically different. This is great news for people from relatively low cost countries. But it is devastating for people living in more expensive countries who will be competing for work with a significantly larger talent pool who can work at a fraction of the cost as their own cost base is much lower. This \"virtual immigration\" will be almost impossible for governments to control.\n\nIt is not just work that will be impacted by the rise of online collaboration. It also has an impact on friends and family relationships.\n\nWho your friends are is heavily dependent on physical proximity. You went to school with your childhood friends. Your first steps into becoming an adult were shared with university friends. You arranged outings with work friends by the coffee machine. And when you moved away from your home town you made new friends with people that went to the same pub or had children at the same school as your own.\n\nSocial distancing means that it is both difficult to meet everyone physically and easy to meet everyone on line. This is having a direct impact on who people are seeing and interacting with during lockdown. Family members living hundreds or thousands of miles apart have started to have virtual lunches or teas. Old school friends living in different towns can have drinks together, after work. New friends can be made as people go online to play multiplayer games on a PlayStation while simultaneously chatting over Skype.\n\nAnother long term trend is the continuing relative decline of the West compared to the East. This should not be a surprise as the power of the West has been in continuous decline since its peak on the eve of World War 1. World War 1 broke Europe up into fragments and triggered the initial loss of European colonies. World War 2 shifted power away from the cradle of Western power, Europe, to its American and Eurasian offshoots, the United States and the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War left the United States as the only Western country as a global power. The wars of distraction in the Middle East and Afghanistan shrunk American power even further and allowed China and East Asia to emerge as full rivals to Western power. The rise of the West was not inevitable. Nor was its fall. It was the result of thousands of individual decisions made by both Western societies and those that it interacted with.\n\nWhat has surprised many Westerners about the Covid 19 outbreak was how well East Asian countries such as China, Korea and Taiwan have managed the crisis, in stark contrast to Western countries. Asian governments responded quickly and competently and their citizens dutifully followed the rules. As a result they managed to save lives and their economies and societies.\n\nMeanwhile, the West has been unable to show any leadership in this crisis. It is not simply that Western countries appeared to be incompetent. Rather Covid 19 revealed structural issues within Western economies. The West was unable to lead on testing for Covid 19 or providing its doctors, nurses and other front line workers with the necessary personal protection equipment such as masks and screens as they no longer had a supply chain that allowed them to make them at home. Covid 19 revealed to the world that the West had outsourced so much to East Asia that it could not look after its own basic needs. We will follow this up later on in this article, but for now Covid 19 has shown the West to be lacking and East Asia to be remarkably resilient.\n\nA few Westerners will reflect on the core reasons why East Asian countries managed Covid 19 better than they did. Is it to do with their culture, their homogeneity, their political system, their economies, their educational systems? What? This process of questioning will be very uncomfortable for most Westerners as Western superiority in most things is something that has been taken for granted for at least 200 years.\n\nCovid 19 has also highlighted a global attitude to safety and the value of individual human lives. Lockdowns, of varying degrees, have been imposed in most countries around the world with the single aim of reducing the number of lives lost by reducing the spread of Covid 19. All other considerations have become secondary. To have such a universal attitude is really remarkable.\n\nThe world has become an increasingly safe place. Premature deaths, caused by disease, accidents and conflict have been declining around the world over the past 100 years. In most parts of the developed world it is unusual for people to know people who have died prematurely. This was not always the case. Childhood mortality used to be rampant as diseases caused by unsafe water killed millions. Accidents in factories were rife.\n\nBit by bit, however, modern advances have prolonged life and premature deaths are now generally caused by the luck of your genes, which can increase the risk of illnesses such as cancer, or are self inflicted, due to poor diet and lack of exercise. Workplace accidents have become rare as companies have been forced to spend more time, money and care in ensuring that employees go home safely to their families. Wars are almost a thing of the past. Very few people today expect to be called up to fight in a global conflict which will kill millions.\n\nAs a result of this trend, the value of each human life has gone up, significantly. Arguably the value of a human life in the West is almost incalculable as the cost of dealing with Covid 19 is adding trillions of dollars of debt to national budgets. The UK, for example, is expected to add an additional GBP 400 billion to the national debt in 2020 alone. Thousands of companies will go bankrupt and hundreds of thousands will lose their jobs and thus incomes. At the time of writing, the UK death toll linked to Covid 19 was 34,000, meaning that each life was the equivalent of GBP 11 million each, only counting the additional government debt.\n\nIt is likely that Covid 19 represents the peak point at which human lives are explicitly valued. Governments cannot continue to borrow at this rate and the economic collapse of entire countries would result if they attempted to do so. Still, it is remarkable how the value of human lives has changed over time.\n\nWe are seeing the emergence of a global culture. In the late 1800s \"human zoos\" popped up all over the West as Europeans and American explorers brought back natives from Africa, Asia and South America and exhibited them in their \"natural states\", frequently naked. People were very different in terms of how they looked, what they wore, how they thought and what they believed. The four previous trends, the value of a human life, the acceleration of our digital selves, the irrelevance of location and the rise of East Asia, underpin a wider trend towards the establishment of a global culture. The similarity of the response by most governments around the world to the Covid 19 outbreak points to a shared way of thinking by political and scientific leaders.\n\nIn part, this has been driven by global trade over the last thirty years, since the collapse of the Soviet Union ended the fragmentation of a world that had been divided into blocks; a first world, led by the United States, a second world, led by the Soviet Union, and a third world, of independent non aligned counties such as India. This trend towards interconnectivity, was then accelerated by India's emergence as a software and back office powerhouse, thanks to the anticipated Y2K crisis, and China's reemergence as a manufacturing powerhouse, thanks to its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001. We now live in a world of just in time global supply chains where people have to be able to communicate with and understand each others' wishes. This is only possible with a greater understanding of a global culture.\n\nThe emergence of companies such as Netflix, who have financed dozens of films and TV shows from all over the world with excellent subtitles and dubbing, means that people are not just listening to Western music but are also enjoying programmes made in dozens of countries. Critically, while those programmes may differ in language and location, the fundamental way of telling stories and creating characters follows a similar, universally understood, template.\n\nThis international culture means that people all over the world increasingly wear the same clothes, listen to the same music and watch the same TV shows and movies. This is also not just a one directional trend emanating from the United States to the rest of the world; Korean pop bands and Spanish bank heist TV shows have become global phenomena.\n\nCovid 19 is going to make global military conflicts less likely. Prior to the outbreak of World War 1, military budgets were relatively small and few countries had large standing armies and conscription. World War 1 dramatically increased military budgets and World War 2 was a bonanza for weapons manufacturers. The long Cold War kept military budgets high, relative to the pre World War 1 era, but after the Cold War ended military budgets dropped significantly, with the exception of the United States and its continued involvement in wars in Muslim countries and its desire to keep spending ahead of other global rivals such as Russia and China.\n\nAs military budgets are reduced, military conflicts are less likely to occur. And military budgets will be cut, due to Covid 19. The first response from governments to the crisis has been to provide more liquidity to their economies by printing and borrowing money on a massive scale. The next phase will be to look at where they can raise taxes to pay for this expenditure and where they can cut costs. The one part of the budget that seems obvious to cut is the military, which has played almost no role during the Covid 19 pandemic. Long term capital programmes and new weapons systems will be postponed, possibly permanently. Recruitment will be frozen and early retirement encouraged.\n\nCovid 19 will also raise questions about the payback of military expenditures. One of the primary duties that a country has to its people is to keep them safe.\n\nThe trillions spent by the US fighting poor Muslim countries have not benefited US citizens. At the same time the military budget has done nothing to fight the Covid 19 pandemic.\n\nMilitary conflict is not just a financial calculation. Culturally it is now harder than ever to go to war. First, people all over the world value life more, something that we have discussed earlier. If they are prepared to spend trillions stopping a disease, it is hard to see people agreeing to fight and die. As a way of contrast, on the first day of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916 the British Army suffered 57,470 casualties, of which 19,240 were killed.\n\nA second reason is that as a global culture emerges people understand each other better and are more empathetic. We have seen how a common culture can change people's perception of \"others\" in the past. A good example is the writing of nineteenth century writers like Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo who described the terrible working and living conditions of poor people in their own countries. This act of humanising people led to legislation that prohibited child labour and improved living and working conditions for the poor. The same thing is happening today. As people from all over the world work together, buy goods and services and enjoy the same TV shows it makes it harder to cast people who are not fellow citizens as evil boogeymen.\n\nFinally, there is the practical question of war. Western countries have discovered that their home supply chains are woefully inadequate for manufacturing things. If Western governments can't provide people with face masks, gloves and test kits it is hard to see them being able to kit out a high tech army to fight a powerful rival.\n\nBroken History\n\nSo far we have discussed the inevitable macro forces that will be assisted and accelerated by the Covid 19 outbreak. As has been mentioned before, those inevitable forces are easier to predict.\n\nIn this section we look at \"broken\" history. These are forces that, prior to Covid 19, seemed to be like an unstoppable freight train steaming down a track. But the pandemic has caused a dangerous break in the track. The freight train might continue onwards, bouncing miraculously back onto the track as though nothing had happened. Equally, the train might be derailed completely. We start with a discussion on the private sector and government, move on to mass migration, globalisation, mass unemployment and then onto climate change. Finally, we discus the wild card of Covid 19, Universal Basic Income.\n\nOver the past thirty years large Western companies have outgrown their national borders and have become global companies. They have been the champions of globalisation, investing in supply chains overseas in a bid to drive down costs and promoting their brands in order to acquire customers in newly emerging, and hopefully lucrative, markets.\n\nAs global companies have become stronger, national governments have become, relatively speaking, weaker. Global companies have shed millions of jobs in their Western homelands and have imported lower cost goods made by lower cost labour back into the West, driving local Western companies, who cannot compete with the lower costs, out of business. This has reduced the tax base of Western governments, and global companies have worked hard to create tax loopholes which allows them to pay even less tax, or no tax at all.\n\nIt is no surprise then, that global companies, some of whom who have market capitalisations larger than the GDP of many countries, have frequently been cast as the villains in recent popular culture. This creeping power of the private sector compared to governments and society seemed to be a permanent, unstoppable, force.\n\nNo more. The coronavirus pandemic has firmly reestablished governments as the most important player in society. Corporations have switched from being bullies, threatening to move their businesses offshore, to being supplicants, begging governments for the funds they need to survive.\n\nUnlike the 2008 Financial Crisis, where governments danced to the tune of the financial sector, Covid 19 has seen governments focus on individual citizens with direct payments being made to employees rather than employers. This appeared to be politically expedient. At the next election incumbent governments will loudly remind voters who it was that saved them from death, eviction and starvation.\n\nBut incumbent political parties may not be the only voice at the next election. Their opponents will remind small business owners that it was government policies that created the lockdowns that destroyed their businesses and lifelong work. Big businesses will try to unshackle themselves from government restrictions and emergency funding packages as fast as they can. Millions of young voters, who were barely affected by Covid 19 directly, may not forgive governments for allowing their welfare and life prospects to be curtailed in order to protect older voters.\n\nWhat is clear is that governments are now having more direct influence in the lives of its citizens than since the end of World War 2. What is not clear is how long this will last.\n\nSince the 1960s Western countries have been open to mass immigration, which has resulted in huge demographic shifts in Western societies. Over the last few years a large minority began to question this open border policy and this pushback was partially responsible for the electoral victories of Trump and Orban in the US and Hungary and the pro-Brexit vote in the UK.\n\nIn order for countries to reduce the spread of Covid 19 they have put in place lockdowns within their borders and many countries have also significantly reduced or restricted the movement of people from outside their borders. If you can't get to a country by plane or boat, or if you need to go into quarantine for 14 days once you enter a country, this will significantly reduce the amount of legal and illegal immigration.\n\nEven if you can get into a country, life for many immigrants will be significantly harder. Unemployment in many Western countries is approaching levels not seen since the Great Depression. There are very few jobs. In addition, furlough schemes, which have been brought in by countries such as Spain and the UK, are only eligible for native citizens, not for immigrants. This lack of jobs and lack of access to financial support for recent immigrants will make it particularly difficult to stay in the country. Finally, even recent immigrants will not welcome new immigrants as they will be competing for the few jobs that are around.\n\nThe question is how long this pause will last. If it is short-lived then there will be little long term change. If lasts a little longer the impact could be more permanent. One of the key dynamics of immigration is that people migrate to places where they already know people, typically family members or friends of family. This \"chain migration\" phenomenon also encourages cross border marriages as new immigrants marry more established immigrants. If those spouses are not available then it is likely that more local intermarrying will take place, which will accelerate the assimilation of immigrants into Western societies and create a break in the chain.\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that this pause in mass immigration will be due to the desire to keep citizens safe, rather than due to a conscious anti immigration policy, which would be seen as highly controversial.\n\nGlobalisation and mass immigration are twinned phenomena that companies find appealing. Global corporations like globalisation as they can manufacture in low cost countries, sell in high income countries and divert profits to low tax countries. National corporations like immigration as it pushes down labour costs, increases the availability of scarce skills, which then pushes down labour costs even further.\n\nFor decades Western citizens accepted both globalisation and mass immigration as they remained relatively wealthy and employable. Their wealth meant that they could afford cheap imported products and could afford the products and services provided immigrants, ranging from farm workers, health workers, builders and cleaners. The relatively low number of immigrants also meant that socially they were not too affected by mass immigration.\n\nOver the past decade the number of Western critics of globalisation and mass immigration has started to increase. And then came Covid 19, which froze just-in-time global supply chains. The West discovered that it could not make the medicines, test kits or personal protection equipment to keep its citizens safe. Globalisation had resulted in a fundamental hollowing out of Western manufacturing capability.\n\nThe initial reaction in Western board rooms, after wondering if Covid 19 was going to push them into bankruptcy, was to examine supply chains and to see where their businesses were vulnerable to Covid 19 based disruption. Many commentators believe that Covid 19 will bring back a wave of re-shoring opportunities.\n\nThis is likely to be wishful thinking. China remains open for business, as does most of East Asia. Western companies are likely to find it easier to deal with Chinese suppliers, who can rely on a network of other Chinese companies that have similarly come out of lockdown, than on Western suppliers who either can't do the work or don't have access to Western supply chains that can provide them with the components they need.\n\nThe only real way to disrupt globalisation is for it to be mandated by Western governments. Normally this would be highly improbable as large global companies have dominated national governments for years. But in a Covid 19 world, where global companies are lining up to take government money, it could be that governments push for more local manufacturing as a condition to getting a bail out.\n\nThere is a real possibility that Covid 19 will result in staggering levels of unemployment in the West. Our economies are like a large game of Jenga. You can pull out an incredible number of blocks and the tower remains standing. Then, all of a sudden, you pull out the final block and the entire structure falls down.\n\nTake the airline industry as a good example of this. Airline travel could be depressed for a very long time as the heating and ventilation systems in airlines means that an infected passenger breathing out Covid 19 air would spread the virus to the entire cabin within a short period of time. Masks and screens will not prevent this. So travel will be restricted. If planes don't fly all the jobs associated with the airline industry will suffer, or collapse, depending on how linked they are. Planes are typically leased, which means the owners of planes won't get their regular payments, which will impact those who receive those payments. Engine manufactures like Rolls Royce, who derive their income from the number of hours a plane is flying, won't get their income. That means they will have to lay off their staff. The airports, which employ thousands, will not need their shops and restaurants, which means those staff will be laid off. Hotels near airports will not be needed. The restaurants near those hotels will not be needed. The taxis that drive passengers from the airport to their destination will not be needed. Tourism heavy economies, like Greece, Spain and Italy, will not get their tourists, which means that the restaurants, shops, hotels, entertainment centres which serve the tourists will not be needed. Companies that make and sell souvenirs, clothing, swim suits, sun glasses, sun screen will all suffer, laying off their staff. The owners of AirB&B houses will not get their rental income which will mean they cant finance their loans they used to buy the flats to rent to tourists and so will default on their loans. Banks will step in to sell their properties but no one will be able to buy the properties and so house prices will fall. And so it goes on. And that is just one sector, linked to the airline industry.\n\nIn the meantime if people stop going to the office, as virtual working becomes easier and entrenched, then the need for offices space, especially in city centres will decline. That means that the restaurants, bars and coffee shops that catered to commuting office workers will not be needed. People will not need two cars at home so car sales will drop, as will maintenance of cars. Railway stations, like airports, will not be as needed as people stop using public transport and so jobs there will be cut. Cleaners working in offices will no longer be needed as few people will be in the office. Many people who live in city centres will question the point in living in a city where you cant go out to the theatre or the cinema or restaurants. If they are wealthy they may have summer houses or cottages and may choose to move there instead, reducing further the consumption in cities and the vitality that makes cities worth living in.\n\nAnd if virtual immigration takes hold then those that can work from home will find themselves competing with other people who can work for less who live in other, low cost countries, all the while pushing unemployment levels up even higher.\n\nThen the question arises about what will happen to all of these unemployed people? What will they do? How will they survive? What forms of support will they get? How will they go back to work? Will there be work for them to go back to?\n\nThe world is getting hotter. There are signs that society is starting to take the problem of climate change seriously. Investors are focusing on low carbon companies, oil companies are diversifying into renewables and people are trying to reduce their personal carbon footprints. However, very little is actually being done to mitigate the risk. Most people who are involved in the detail of climate change issues think that it is more likely that the world will experience runaway climate change than a slowing and reversing of the problem. The scale of the problem and the numbers of people entering the global middle class is so large that any progress made in one area is offset by growth in emissions elsewhere.\n\nAttempts to mitigate climate change have always failed as the time horizons have never been urgent. It might be warmer this year than last year, but not by much. Next year might be warmer than this year, but not by much. As a result it has always been possible to push doing anything about climate change to next year and the year after.\n\nWhat Covid 19 has shown is that governments and society can respond to a short term crisis extremely quickly. Covid 19 was not on the radar of most governments in January / February 2020 and yet by March/April 2020 they had locked down their entire economy, restricted the movements of free citizens and had put in place massive government support mechanisms that actually distributed cash. It is interesting to note that greenhouse emissions during the first few months of 2020 dropped to levels not seen since 2006; Covid 19 has been a significant break on economic activity and thus emissions.\n\nFor some, the speed at which societies agreed to measures to deal with Covid 19 is encouraging. It shows that we can collectively respond to a global crisis. They are proposing a green comeback with investments in low carbon infrastructure and projects as a way to both bring back the economy and help the climate at the same time. They are trying to make the best use of a crisis. That is admirable.\n\nUnfortunately, climate change is relentless. Most people don't like being in lockdown. Most people don't like losing their job. Most people don't like not being able to go out to dinner or go travelling. Once lockdown is over those who can will embrace their freedom. Those who cant, as they have lost their jobs, will wait until things get better again, which they will, eventually. And then they will embrace their freedom too. And in the meantime, hundreds of millions of people in lower income countries will enter the middle class and will want to be part of the global culture of consumption that they can see on their smart phones and TVs. Yet by the 2070s some three billion people will live in places that are near un-livable, due to climate change as average temperatures exceed 29C.\n\nBut there are a lot of tomorrows between now and 1 January 2070. Governments will argue, with some justification, that their priority must be on the here and now. Once they have dealt with the Covid 19 pandemic, and its aftermath, they can get back to thinking about climate change.\n\nFinally, we arrive at Universal Basic Income, which might has the potential to be the most disruptive impact of the Covid 19 pandemic, on a scale similar to the introduction of income tax by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger in 1799 as a \"temporary\" tax to pay for Britain's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe concept of Universal Basic Income is not new and many countries have trialled it, to varying degrees of success. It is also a variation of the Roman concept of bread and circuses. Rome, and then its successor Byzantium, provided a grain and then a bread dole to all citizens living in the capital. This was massively popular and made Rome one of the largest cities in the ancient world, with over one million citizens.\n\nThe key concept is that governments will pay every citizen a minimum amount of income per month. This income would replace all other benefits, such as unemployment and housing benefits, and would be easy to administer. People would be encouraged to work and working would not impact on the amount of Universal Basic Income that they received. This is different to unemployment benefit, which makes low paid work unappealing as while you may make a bit more than getting benefits, the downside was that you had to work for it. The cost benefit analysis of low paid work is bad.\n\nUniversal Basic Income has both left and right wing political support. But there are serious questions. Two obvious ones are how much people should be paid and where the money will come to pay for it. In addition, some say that Universal Basic Income will make people lazy and reliant on government hand outs. Yet millions of people work hard today without any income: school children do not earn money and are paid for by their parents, retired people do not earn money and are paid for via pensions and savings and many spouses earn little or no income and are supported by their other spouse. All those groups contribute to society while they can, either by studying, home making or doing volunteer work. Looking back historically, very few people worked for money as they predominantly lived in barter and self reliant communities.\n\nThe Covid 19 pandemic has given a number of governments the opportunity to trial schemes similar to Universal Basic Income on a mass scale. The UK government, for example, has introduced a Covid 19 furlough scheme of up to GBP 2,500 per month for employees who would otherwise have been made redundant, due to Covid 19. It has also introduced a variation of this for self employed people, also for up to GBP 2,500 per month, with essentially no questions asked. This is not explicitly a Universal Basic Income scheme and will only last for 6 months. Canada has introduced an even simpler system, by inverting the tax receipt system into a cash payout system, of $2000 per adult and $500 per child per month. The United States has sent cheques, ostentatiously signed by President Trump, to millions of families for similar reasons. Spain has taken a bigger step and has put in a scheme which is explicitly a Universal Basic Income scheme and is designed to be permanent. The Scottish government is also pushing for a Universal Basic Income scheme to be put in place.\n\nIf the Covid 19 pandemic lasts a long time it is likely that some form of Universal Basic Income will be rolled out in many countries. If job losses due to Covid 19 are large and long lasting, unemployment benefits will be a poor solution. There will be few jobs for unemployed people to move to and restrictions on working while being on unemployment benefits will discourage people from taking those jobs, unless the wages are significantly better. Universal Basic Income would provide a simpler way of providing similar levels of benefit and would encourage people to get back to work, which will then stimulate the economy creating more jobs for more people to start working in again.\n\nOnce it is in place, however, it may, like income tax, become a permanent feature in society.\n\nIt is time to wrap things up. Covid 19 has shown that the world, for all its superficial differences, has become an increasingly similar place. The world is more linked than ever before. The mass global migration of people from all over the world into Western countries has not just brought non Europeans into Europe and its major European former colonies, such as the United States and Australia, but has also transmitted Western ideas and values back to the rest of the world. Western corporate champions evolved into global businesses which then tied the world even closer, with factories in China and call centres in India. The East learned from the West and Eastern business giants are now using the same links to sell goods and services back to the West and to expand into new markets in the Rest of the world. Western companies and governments have seen how effective the East has been in dealing with the Covid 19 outbreak and the most inquisitive will look to the East for good ideas about governance and corporate strategy.\n\nThe physical interconnectivity of the last twenty years has now become increasingly digital. The Covid 19 induced lockdown has accelerated the birth of an online virtual world where everyone has been forced to work and play together, irrespective of physical distance. The numbers of virtual immigrants will exceed physical immigrants as millions of potential migrants in relatively low cost countries stay put and virtually work for companies in relatively high cost countries. As they join their colleagues in Zoom and Microsoft Meetings they will preface their work with chit chats about the latest e-sports games, TV shows and movies that they all have been watching on similar digital streaming platforms. Finally, as the physical and virtual ties increase the likelihood of armed conflict between great powers decreases.\n\nCovid 19 is going to be particularly difficult for many Western countries. Large percentages of their economies are linked to the service and entertainment sectors, rather than manufacturing or primary extraction of raw materials. Millions of jobs that require physical interactions, such as restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, sports stadia, supermarkets, shopping malls and amusement parks are at risk. In the meantime, all service sector jobs that don't need to be done in the office such as those in finance, law, accounting, design, marketing, digital arts, software development and TV and movie post production are also at risk from virtual immigrants. The furlough schemes that are now in place in many countries could be replaced by long term Universal Basic Income schemes which will support a basic, but adequate, standard of living, with less consumption. This will enhance the role of government as more people are reliant on government rather than private companies for their income.\n\nThe wild card remains climate change. A world that is more online and virtual needs less physical stuff. You don't need energy to make and then transport things. You don't need energy to move people from home to office. That should make the world less energy intensive on a per capita basis. Covid 19 has shown that governments and societies can respond very quickly, on a massive scale, to an immediate, specific, crisis. Climate change is not immediate and it is not specific. By the time it is really bad it will simply be too late to do anything about it. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is cumulative. Each tonne that was emitted 100 years ago is still in the atmosphere today. Each tonne that is emitted today will be around in 100 years in the future. A sudden cut in emissions - such as caused by Covid 19 - does virtually nothing to change this.\n\nThe only hope we have of dealing with climate change is that the common desire to save lives, as shown by the near universal responses by government to Covid 19, and the common global culture that is emerging will create a social consensus among all people in all countries to take significant steps to mitigate climate change, while we can. Otherwise, those predictions of 3 billion people living in places that are essentially un-livable by 2070 will become our reality.\n\nThat is a problem far worse than Covid 19.\n\nApril 2024 - how did this article age?\n\nThe article was written at the start of the Covid 19 pandemic. What went right and what went wrong with the thesis.\n\n1. The pandemic has indeed accelerated the shift towards digitalization, remote work, and online services.\n\n2. East Asian countries have generally managed the crisis more effectively than Western nations, highlighting the shifting balance of power.\n\n3. Governments have taken on a more interventionist role in response to the pandemic, providing financial support to citizens and businesses.\n\n4. The crisis has exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains and the West's reliance on manufacturing in other countries.\n\n1. The claim that the pandemic will significantly reduce military conflicts seems overly optimistic, especially since we have had a war in the Ukraine and a conflict in Israel / Gaza. While economic challenges may limit military spending, geopolitical tensions and regional disputes may persist.\n\n2. The article's prediction of a drastic decline in mass migration was wrong. While the pandemic temporarily restricted movement, the underlying factors driving migration, such as economic inequality and political instability, remain.\n\nClash of Titans: How the Warrior Ethos and Judeo-Christian Monotheism Shaped the Soul of the West",

Even the world's most vocal free speech advocate finds it difficult to resist the combined pressure of governments that control market access.\n\nThis is a History Future Now article. So we are going to do what we always do: look at the present through the lens of the past, and then look at where the future is heading. The question is simple. What happens to civilisations that control speech? And what happens to those that do not?\n\nThe historical record is unambiguous. And it is not comfortable reading for anyone who believes that the state should decide what its citizens are allowed to say, hear, or think.\n\nPart 1: Athens -- The Power of the Open Agora\n\nIn the fifth century BC, a small city on the Aegean peninsula produced more intellectual, artistic, and political innovation in a single century than most civilisations produce in a millennium. Athens gave the world democracy, philosophy, theatre, history, rhetoric, geometry, medicine, and the foundations of Western science. The names alone tell the story: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Hippocrates, Pericles.\n\nAthens was not peaceful. It was not gentle. It was not tolerant by modern standards -- it excluded women, slaves, and foreigners from political participation. But it had one quality that distinguished it from every other city-state in the ancient world: it allowed, and indeed celebrated, open public debate.\n\nThe agora -- the central public space of Athens -- was where citizens gathered to argue about politics, philosophy, ethics, and anything else that interested them. The theatre staged plays that openly mocked political leaders, questioned the gods, and explored the darkest aspects of human nature. The law courts operated on the principle that any citizen could bring a prosecution and any citizen could defend themselves through public argument. The philosophical schools -- Plato's Academy, Aristotle's Lyceum -- operated as open forums where ideas were tested through rigorous dialectical debate.\n\nThis culture of open argument was not accidental. It was structural. Athenian democracy required citizens to make decisions on matters of war, peace, taxation, and public works through direct vote in the Assembly. To vote intelligently, citizens needed information and argument. Restricting debate would have undermined the entire political system. The Athenians understood, intuitively, that the quality of decisions depends on the quality of the information available to decision-makers.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Athens, with a population of perhaps 300,000 (including slaves and non-citizens), produced an intellectual and cultural output that shaped the entire subsequent trajectory of Western civilisation. No comparable city in the ancient world -- not Sparta, not Corinth, not Thebes -- came close.\n\nPart 2: Sparta -- The Cost of Control\n\nSparta provides the counter-example. The Spartans created perhaps the most controlled society in the ancient world. Every aspect of Spartan life was regulated by the state. Boys were taken from their families at age seven and subjected to a brutal military training regime (the agoge). Speech was controlled -- the term \"laconic\" (from Laconia, the region around Sparta) literally means \"using few words.\" Foreigners were periodically expelled (xenelasia) to prevent contamination by outside ideas. Travel abroad was restricted. Innovation was discouraged. The Spartan constitution, attributed to the semi-mythical Lycurgus, was treated as sacred and essentially unchangeable.\n\nSparta produced formidable soldiers. It won the Peloponnesian War against Athens. But it produced virtually nothing else. No Spartan philosopher, poet, playwright, historian, scientist, or artist is remembered today. Sparta's contribution to human civilisation, beyond the military arts, is effectively zero.\n\nMore importantly, Sparta's rigidity made it unable to adapt. Its system depended on a large population of helots (serfs) who outnumbered Spartan citizens by as much as seven to one. When Spartan citizen numbers declined -- because the system was so demanding that fewer families could meet the requirements for full citizenship -- the entire structure became unsustainable. By the third century BC, Sparta had fewer than 1,000 full citizens and had become a military irrelevance. The society that had controlled everything could not control the one thing that mattered: its own demographic decline.\n\nThe parallel with modern attempts to control information is instructive. Societies that prioritise control over openness may achieve short-term stability and even military power. But they sacrifice the adaptability, innovation, and self-correction that come from allowing people to speak freely, challenge orthodoxies, and propose new ideas. In the long run, the open society outperforms the closed one -- not because openness is morally superior (though many would argue it is), but because it is functionally superior. Open societies process information better, correct errors faster, and innovate more effectively.\n\nPart 3: The Islamic Golden Age -- Openness Ascendant, Then Lost\n\nThe Islamic Golden Age (roughly 750-1258 AD) provides one of history's most dramatic demonstrations of what happens when a civilisation embraces intellectual openness -- and what happens when it stops.\n\nUnder the Abbasid Caliphate, centred in Baghdad, the Islamic world became the intellectual leader of the planet. The House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma) in Baghdad was the world's greatest centre of learning. Scholars translated the Greek philosophical and scientific corpus into Arabic, preserving works that would otherwise have been lost. They then built upon this knowledge, making original contributions in mathematics (algebra, algorithms), astronomy, medicine, optics, chemistry, and philosophy that were centuries ahead of contemporary Europe.\n\nThis intellectual flowering was not an accident. It was the product of a culture that valued intellectual inquiry and tolerated -- indeed, encouraged -- debate. The practice of ijtihad (independent reasoning) allowed scholars to interpret religious texts in light of new knowledge and changing circumstances. Theological disputes were conducted openly. Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and Muslims studied alongside each other. The Caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833) personally hosted debates between scholars of different faiths and philosophical traditions.\n\nThe decline began when this openness was curtailed. The closing of the \"gates of ijtihad\" -- the gradual consensus that independent reasoning on matters of religious law was no longer permissible -- is one of the most consequential intellectual events in history. The exact date and nature of this \"closing\" is debated by scholars, but the effect is not: Islamic intellectual culture shifted from creative inquiry to the preservation and commentary of existing texts. Original research declined. The sciences stagnated. The philosophical tradition withered.\n\nBy the time the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258, the Islamic world's intellectual leadership had already been eroding for generations. The Mongol destruction was catastrophic -- the House of Wisdom was destroyed, its books thrown into the Tigris -- but it was the culmination of a decline, not its cause. The cause was the decision, made incrementally over centuries, to restrict the range of permissible thought.\n\nThe Islamic world never recovered its intellectual pre-eminence. The very civilisation that had given Europe algebra, the concept of zero, and the preservation of Aristotle found itself, by the sixteenth century, falling behind a Europe that had embraced the very intellectual traditions that the Islamic world had abandoned: open inquiry, empirical investigation, and the willingness to challenge received wisdom.\n\nPart 4: The Soviet Experiment -- Controlling Everything\n\nThe Soviet Union represents the most thorough modern attempt to control information. The Communist Party controlled every newspaper, every radio station, every television channel, every publishing house, every school curriculum, and every public lecture. Censorship was not a side effect of the system. It was the system. The entire apparatus of the state was designed to ensure that Soviet citizens received only the information that the Party deemed appropriate.\n\nThe results were predictable to anyone who had studied history, and catastrophic for those who had not.\n\nSoviet science, which had produced genuine breakthroughs in the early decades (rocketry, nuclear physics, mathematics), was progressively crippled by ideological interference. Trofim Lysenko's pseudoscientific theories about genetics -- which aligned with Marxist ideology but contradicted actual biology -- were imposed as official doctrine from the 1930s to the 1960s. Scientists who objected were imprisoned, exiled, or killed. Soviet agriculture suffered catastrophically as a result, contributing to famines that killed millions.\n\nSoviet economics operated on similarly distorted information. Central planners could not get accurate data about production, demand, or quality because every level of the system had incentives to falsify reports. Factory managers overstated output to meet quotas. Regional officials inflated statistics to please Moscow. Moscow published the inflated statistics as evidence of socialist superiority. The entire economy was running on lies, and the people at the top had no way of knowing it -- because they had destroyed the mechanisms (free press, independent auditors, market prices) that would have told them the truth.\n\nThe samizdat (self-published) underground demonstrated that even the most comprehensive censorship regime in history could not fully suppress the flow of information. Dissidents hand-typed manuscripts and passed them from person to person, creating an alternative information network that, while tiny, proved that the human desire to communicate freely is essentially impossible to extinguish.\n\nThe Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 -- not because it was invaded, but because it could no longer function. A system built on controlled information could not process the information it needed to survive. The censorship that was supposed to protect the regime was the very thing that destroyed it, by blinding it to its own failures.\n\nPart 5: The Digital Dilemma\n\nEvery previous technology for controlling information -- book burning, licensing of printers, state monopoly over broadcasting -- was eventually defeated by new technology. The printing press defeated the Church's manuscript monopoly. Cheap newspapers defeated government licensing. Radio and television defeated state control of the printed word. The internet defeated state control of broadcasting.\n\nAI-powered censorship represents something qualitatively different. For the first time in history, governments have access to technology that can monitor, filter, and suppress speech at a scale and speed that no previous censorship regime could match. China's Great Firewall, combined with AI-driven content moderation, can identify and remove a social media post within seconds of its publication. India's three-hour takedown rule, enforced by AI systems, approaches real-time censorship. The EU's Digital Services Act, backed by algorithmic auditing tools, creates a compliance burden that effectively forces platforms to over-censor rather than risk regulatory penalties.\n\nThe question is whether AI-powered censorship will prove to be the exception to the historical rule -- whether, for the first time, a censorship technology will be powerful enough to suppress dissent permanently without the self-defeating consequences that destroyed every previous attempt.\n\nThomas Sowell's insight about markets applies equally to information: no central authority, no matter how intelligent or well-intentioned, can process information as effectively as a distributed system of free agents making independent decisions. Central planning of information -- which is what censorship is -- suffers from the same fundamental problem as central planning of the economy: the planners cannot know what they do not know. The information they suppress may be precisely the information they need to make good decisions. The dissent they silence may be the early warning of a problem that will destroy them.\n\nPart 6: What Comes Next\n\nThe 2030s will see a divergence between open and closed information societies, with consequences as profound as the divergence between Athens and Sparta.\n\nOn one side will be nations that embrace open discourse -- including speech that is uncomfortable, offensive, or politically inconvenient. These nations will benefit from faster error correction, more effective innovation, and greater social resilience. They will attract the world's most talented and ambitious people, who will gravitate toward places where they can think, speak, and create without fear.\n\nOn the other side will be nations that use AI to enforce ever-more-comprehensive control over what their citizens can say, read, and think. These nations will achieve a surface stability that looks impressive -- orderly, efficient, conflict-free. But beneath the surface, they will accumulate errors, suppress innovation, and lose the adaptive capacity that allows societies to respond to unexpected challenges.\n\nThe EU risks becoming a \"comfortable Sparta\" -- a civilisation that is orderly, well-regulated, and intellectually sterile. Its regulatory approach to speech and AI, however well-intentioned, creates a compliance culture that punishes dissent and rewards conformity. The Digital Services Act does not just regulate platforms. It creates an incentive structure in which platforms systematically remove anything that might attract regulatory attention -- which means anything controversial, provocative, or genuinely new. The result is a public discourse that is safe, bland, and incapable of producing the kind of radical thinking that drives civilisational progress.\n\nThe historical pattern is clear and consistent across millennia: civilisations that control speech decline. They decline not because censorship makes people unhappy (though it does), but because it makes societies stupid. It blinds leaders to reality. It prevents the identification and correction of errors. It drives talented people away. It replaces genuine debate with performance and compliance.\n\nEvery civilisation that has chosen the silence of the scribes has eventually been overtaken by one that let its people speak. There is no reason to believe that the twenty-first century will be different.\n\nThe only question is which nations will learn from history, and which will repeat it.\n\nThe Death Of The Fourth Estate: What The Collapse Of Newspapers Means For Democracy, Power, And Truth",

      "full_text": "Introduction\n\nThroughout history, war has left an indelible mark on society, transforming the lives of those who survive and reshaping the roles of both men and women. While the devastating impact of conflict on the battlefield is well-documented, the true extent of war's influence on society, particularly in relation to the loss of young men and the subsequent changes in women's roles, is often overlooked.\n\nIn this article, History Future Now argues that the staggering loss of young male lives in major conflicts, spanning from the Thirty Years' War to World War II, has had far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the battlefield. These losses have forced women to step into roles traditionally occupied by men, both in the workplace and in the political arena, while also compelling the state to take on the responsibilities of the male provider.\n\nAs a result, the very fabric of society has been transformed, leading to the rise of the modern welfare state and a fundamental shift in the traditional roles of men and women. The impact of these changes are vast and complex, affecting everything from individual autonomy to the traditional family structure.\n\nTo support this thesis, we will analyse the impact of six major conflicts on the young male population and trace the cascading effects of these losses on women's roles and the state. By examining the interconnectedness of war, gender roles, and societal change, we aim to shed light on the unintended consequences of conflict and the uncertain future that lies ahead.\n\nPart 1: The Wars and Their Impact on Young Men\n\nThis first part of the argument really sets the scene. We will go through a number of conflicts over time to show the significantly larger loss of life by men over women during key conflicts and specifically the loss of young men. Losing such a large segment of your population creates a vacuum that needs to be filled, which we will discuss in Part 2.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War was a tragedy of unparalleled proportions in German history, leaving behind a shattered, depopulated, and impoverished country.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War was a conflict primarily fought in Central Europe, involving most of the European powers. The war began as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics within the Holy Roman Empire but evolved into a broader struggle for political power and territory. The conflict ended with the Peace of Westphalia, which redrew the political map of Europe and established the concept of state sovereignty.\n\nThe war resulted in an estimated 4 to 12 million deaths, with a significant portion being young men. Germany, which was the primary theater of the war, lost an estimated 20% to 40% of its population, with some regions losing up to 70% of their inhabitants. To put the scale of these losses into perspective, the total number of deaths in the Thirty Years' War is equivalent to 4 to 11 times the current population of Birmingham (1.1 million). Civilian casualties were also high, with widespread famine, disease, and violence affecting the population, but the impact on young men was significantly greater.\n\nOne example of the war's impact on a specific region is the city of Magdeburg, which was besieged and sacked by Imperial forces in 1631. The city, which had a pre-war population of around 25,000, was reduced to just 5,000 survivors, with a large portion of the dead being young men who had fought to defend the city.\n\nThe war, driven by religious and political rivalries, resulted in immense human suffering and economic ruin, with the effects felt for generations. The loss of such a significant portion of the young male population had long-lasting consequences. Many regions of Germany experienced severe population declines, with some areas not recovering their pre-war population levels until the 19th century. The shortage of young men led to a breakdown in social order, with increased crime, poverty, and the abandonment of agricultural land. The war also had a profound impact on the institution of marriage, with many women unable to find husbands due to the shortage of men.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars were the first truly European conflict, involving armies of unprecedented size and causing destruction on an unparalleled scale.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a series of conflicts fought between France, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, and various coalitions of European powers. The wars began with Napoleon's rise to power and his expansionist ambitions and ended with his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and subsequent exile. The conflicts resulted in significant changes to the political landscape of Europe.\n\nThe wars resulted in an estimated 3 to 7 million military deaths, with a male-to-female death ratio that heavily skewed towards men. France alone suffered up to 1.7 million military deaths, representing a significant portion of its young male population. The total number of military deaths in the Napoleonic Wars is equivalent to 6 times the current population of Birmingham. Civilian casualties were also high, with widespread destruction, famine, and disease affecting the populations of the involved nations, but the impact on young men was significantly greater.\n\nThe scale of the losses can be illustrated by the example of the Grande Armée, the main French army under Napoleon's command during the invasion of Russia in 1812. The Grande Armée initially consisted of around 685,000 men, but by the end of the campaign, only about 10,000 survived, with the vast majority of the dead being young men.\n\nThe loss of so many young men led to demographic shifts, economic challenges, and social changes in the affected nations. In France, the shortage of young men led to a decline in birth rates and a shift towards smaller families. The wars also had a significant impact on the economy, with many industries struggling to recover from the loss of skilled workers. The social upheaval caused by the wars contributed to the rise of new political movements and the spread of revolutionary ideas across Europe.\n\nThe Crimean War was a conflict that showed the world the horrors of modern warfare and the importance of medical care for soldiers.\n\nThe war was a conflict primarily fought between Russia and an alliance of Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire. The war began as a dispute over the control of holy sites in Jerusalem and escalated into a broader struggle for influence in the Black Sea region. The conflict ended with Russia's defeat and the reordering of the balance of power in Europe.\n\nThe war resulted in an estimated 336,000 to 623,000 male combat deaths, with a male-to-female combat death ratio of 3.5:1. The Russian Empire lost between 4 and 11% of its male population aged 18-30, while the Ottoman Empire lost up to 3.7%. Civilian casualties were relatively limited compared to later conflicts, but the war had a significant impact on local populations through displacement and economic disruption.\n\nThe loss of so many young men had demographic, economic, and social implications for the affected countries. In Russia, the war led to a significant decline in the male population, particularly in rural areas where many of the soldiers were recruited from. This demographic imbalance persisted for generations, affecting marriage patterns, family structures, and social norms. The war also had a significant impact on the Russian economy, with the loss of young men leading to labor shortages in agriculture and industry.\n\nThe American Civil War began with the secession of southern states from the Union and was fought primarily over the issue of slavery. The war ended with the defeat of the Confederacy and the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe conflict claimed an estimated 620,000 to 750,000 military lives, with a male-to-female combat death ratio of 11:1 for the Union and 6:1 for the Confederate States. The Confederate States experienced a higher percentage of male fighting-age deaths, with 18% to 20% of its male population aged 18-30 killed in combat, compared to the Union's 13%.\n\nThe impact of the war on specific communities can be seen in the example of the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The Battle of Gettysburg resulted in over 50,000 casualties, with a significant portion of the dead being young men from both the Union and Confederate armies.\n\nThe good news was that the war resulted in the preservation of the United States and the end of slavery. The bad news was that it came at a tremendous cost in young lives and left deep scars on American society. The war led to a significant decline in the male population in the Confederate states, with some areas losing up to a fifth of their men. This demographic imbalance had far-reaching consequences, affecting marriage rates, family structures, and gender roles. The war also had a devastating impact on the Southern economy, with the loss of slave labor and the destruction of infrastructure. The social and political upheaval caused by the war laid the groundwork for the civil rights struggles of the 20th century.\n\nThe First World War was a catastrophe for Europe, a cataclysm that destroyed a civilisation and set the stage for the even greater horrors of the Second World War.\n\nWorld War I was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and quickly escalated into a global conflict. The war began as a complex web of alliances and nationalist fervour and soon devolved into a brutal stalemate characterised by trench warfare and unprecedented loss of life. The conflict ended with the defeat of the Central Powers and significant changes to the global political landscape.\n\nThe impact of the war on individual soldiers can be seen in the example of Wilfred Owen, a British poet who fought in the war and whose works, such as \"Dulce et Decorum Est,\" vividly depicted the horrors of trench warfare. Owen was killed in action just one week before the war ended, his life cut short like so many other young men of his generation.\n\nIn France, the war led to a significant decline in the male population, with the country losing nearly 1.4 million men. This demographic imbalance had far-reaching effects on French society, with many women unable to find husbands and a significant decline in birth rates. The shortage of young men also had economic consequences, with labor shortages in key industries and a slow post-war recovery.\n\nIn Germany, the war's impact was even more severe. The country lost approximately 2 million men, representing a staggering 25% to 31% of its male population aged 18-30. This demographic catastrophe had profound consequences for German society, contributing to the rise of the \"Lost Generation,\" a term used to describe the generation of young people who came of age during the war and struggled to find their place in the post-war world. The shortage of young men also had economic and social consequences, with labor shortages and a rise in alternative lifestyles, such as lesbianism and transgenderism, in the Weimar Republic. These lifestyles were highly subversive and the fight against proved a rallying cry for Hitler and his more conservative German followers.\n\nIn Russia, the war's impact was compounded by the country's social and political upheaval. The country lost an estimated 1.8 million men, representing 18.70% of its male population aged 18-30. The war's devastating toll on the Russian population, combined with widespread food shortages and political unrest, contributed to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917. Without the war it is highly likely that the revolution, had it even happened, would have been crushed by the army. The revolution led to the collapse of the Russian Empire, the horrors of the Red Terror and the establishment of the murderous Soviet Union which killed millions more of its own people, predominantly men.\n\nWorld War II began with Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939 and remains the deadliest conflict in human history. The war was fuelled by fascist aggression and expansionism and ended with the defeat of the Axis powers and significant changes to the global political landscape.\n\nThe conflict claimed an estimated 70-85 million lives, including both military and civilian casualties. The war resulted in an estimated 16-22 million male combat deaths, with a male-to-female combat death ratio of 16:1 in the Soviet Union, 30:1 in China, and 12.8:1 in Germany. To put the scale of these losses into perspective, the total number of male combat deaths in World War II is equivalent to 15 to 20 times the current population of Birmingham. Another way of visualising that number is that if all these men were standing shoulder to shoulder it would stretch to over 6,800 miles, which is about the distance from London to Vladivostok on Russia's Pacific coast. The war's impact on young men was particularly severe, with the Soviet Union losing up to 49% of its male population aged 18-30, and Germany losing around 45%.\n\nThe impact of the war on individual cities can be seen in the example of Stalingrad, which was the site of one of the bloodiest battles in history. The Battle of Stalingrad resulted in an estimated 1.8 to 2 million casualties, with a significant portion of the dead being young Soviet men who defended the city against the German onslaught. The scale of the losses had a profound impact on the city and its population, with many families losing multiple generations of men.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that World War II also had a devastating impact on civilians, with an estimated 40-55 million civilian deaths. Women were particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, with an estimated 1.9-2.5 million rapes committed by enemy forces, affecting between 2% to 4% of the female population aged 18-30 in the Soviet Union and 2% to 4% in Germany. While these numbers are terrible and shocking, they are still significantly lower than the percentage of young men killed in combat.\n\nThe loss of so many young men had profound and long-lasting consequences for the countries involved. In the Soviet Union, the demographic imbalance caused by the war persisted for generations, with women outnumbering men well into the 1960s. This imbalance affected marriage patterns, family structures, and gender roles, with many women forced to take on traditionally male roles in the workforce and society.\n\nIn Germany, the war's aftermath saw a significant decline in the male population, with many young men killed, imprisoned, or forced to work as labourers in the post-war reconstruction effort. This shortage of men had far-reaching effects on German society, contributing to the advent of mass immigration, the rise of alternative lifestyles and the erosion of traditional gender norms. The war also had a profound impact on the global economy, with many countries struggling to rebuild in the face of massive destruction and the loss of a significant portion of their workforce.\n\nPart 2: The Impact of War on Women's Roles in Society and the Rise of the Welfare State\n\nThe loss of young men in conflicts, whether through death or prolonged absence, had a profound impact on the roles of women in society and the expansion of government support.\n\nAs husbands and fathers were killed or called away to serve for months or years at a time, women were forced to step into roles traditionally occupied by men in both the workplace and the political arena. They also had to take on more responsibility for decision-making within the family, which ultimately led to a desire for greater autonomy and political representation.\n\nSimultaneously, the state began to fill the void left by the loss of male breadwinners, leading to the rise of the welfare state. This section will explore these changes in the context of each conflict.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War had a significant impact on the role of women in German society. With a substantial portion of the male population killed or away fighting, women were forced to take on new responsibilities both within the household and in the public sphere. Many women took over their husbands' businesses, such as blacksmithing, carpentry, and cobbling, ensuring the continuation of vital economic activities. Women also took on roles in agriculture, such as managing farms and livestock, which were essential for feeding their families and communities.\n\nIn some cases, women even took on roles in local government, such as managing the distribution of food and resources in their communities. For example, in the city of Nuremberg, women were appointed as \"bread weighers\" to ensure that bakers were not cheating their customers during times of scarcity.\n\nTo support women and children left behind, some German states began to provide limited assistance. In the city of Augsburg, for example, the government established a fund to provide financial support to widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the war. While these measures were not comprehensive, they represented an early recognition of the state's responsibility to support vulnerable populations.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars had a similar impact on women's roles in French society. As men were conscripted into the military and sent away to fight, women were left to manage households, businesses, and farms. Women's participation in the workforce increased significantly during this period, particularly in the textile industry, where they made up the majority of workers in some factories. Women also took on roles in the production of war materials, such as making cartridges and sewing uniforms.\n\nTo support soldiers' families, the French government established the \"Conseil de Famille\" (Family Council) in 1806, which provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were killed or disabled in the war. The Council provided pensions to widows and orphans, as well as assistance with housing and education. This early form of state welfare was limited in scope but set a precedent for future government support programs.\n\nThe Crimean War is notable for the significant role played by women in nursing and medical care. Florence Nightingale, a British nurse, gained fame for her work in improving sanitary conditions and patient care in military hospitals. Her efforts helped to professionalize nursing and establish it as a respectable occupation for women.\n\nTo support the families of soldiers, the British government established the Royal Patriotic Fund in 1854. The Fund provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were killed or disabled in the war, including pensions for widows and grants for the education of orphans. The Fund was one of the first examples of a government-sponsored welfare program in Britain and set a precedent for future social support initiatives.\n\nThe American Civil War had a profound impact on the role of women in American society, particularly in the South. With a significant portion of the male population fighting in the war, women were forced to take on new roles in the household and the workforce. Many women worked in factories, particularly in the textile industry, producing uniforms, blankets, and other supplies for the war effort. Women also took on roles in agriculture, managing farms and plantations in the absence of their husbands.\n\nIn the North, women played a significant role in the abolitionist movement and in supporting the Union war effort. Women formed local soldiers' aid societies, which provided food, clothing, and medical supplies to Union soldiers. They also worked as nurses in military hospitals and on the front lines.\n\nTo support soldiers and their families, the US government established the Pension Bureau in 1862. The Bureau provided pensions to disabled soldiers and the widows and orphans of soldiers who died in the war. By 1894, the Bureau was providing pensions to nearly one million Civil War veterans and their families, making it one of the largest government programs in US history.\n\nWorld War I had a profound impact on women's roles in society, as the scale of the conflict and the mass mobilization of men led to a significant increase in women's participation in the workforce. In Britain, for example, women took on roles in munitions factories, producing shells, bullets, and other war materials. Women also worked in transportation, as bus and tram conductors, and in agriculture, helping to feed the nation.\n\nTo support soldiers and their families, the British government introduced the Separation Allowance in 1914, which provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were serving in the war. The government also introduced the War Widows' Pension in 1916, which provided pensions to the widows of soldiers who died in the war. These programs were significant steps towards the development of a comprehensive welfare state in Britain.\n\nIn Germany, the government introduced the National Pension Law in 1920, which provided pensions to war widows and orphans. The law recognised the sacrifices made by soldiers and their families and the government's responsibility to support them.\n\nThe increased responsibility and decision-making power that women gained during the war led to a growing desire for greater political representation and autonomy. In many countries, women's suffrage movements gained momentum in the aftermath of the war, as women demanded the right to vote and participate in the political process. In Britain, for example, women over the age of 30 were granted the right to vote in 1918, in recognition of their contributions to the war effort.\n\nWorld War II had a similar impact on women's roles in society, as the mass mobilisation of men led to a significant increase in women's participation in the workforce. In the United States, women took on roles in factories, producing aircraft, ships, and other war materials. The iconic image of \"Rosie the Riveter\" came to symbolise the millions of American women who entered the industrial workforce to support the war effort. Women's participation in the U.S. labor force increased from 27% to 37% during the war years, marking a significant shift in gender roles and expectations.\n\nWomen also served in the military during World War II, with over 350,000 women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces alone. Women took on roles such as nurses, administrators, and pilots, challenging traditional notions of women's capabilities and roles in society.\n\nThe war also saw women making significant contributions in the realms of science and technology. Women like Hedy Lamarr, a Hollywood actress and inventor, co-invented a frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication system that laid the foundation for modern wireless technology. The many women who worked as codebreakers at Bletchley Park in England, including mathematician Alan Turing's team, played a crucial role in deciphering German codes and contributed to the Allied victory.\n\nThe prolonged absence of men during the war led to changes in family dynamics and gender roles. Women took on greater responsibility for decision-making and the management of household affairs, as well as the primary responsibility for raising children. Women had to make important decisions about the allocation of resources, the education of their children, and the care of elderly relatives, which gave them a greater sense of autonomy and control over their lives.\n\nTo support soldiers and their families, the US government passed the Servicemen's Dependents Allowance Act in 1942, which provided financial assistance to the families of soldiers who were serving in the war. The government also passed the G.I. Bill in 1944, which provided education and training benefits to veterans, as well as low-interest loans for housing and business start-ups.\n\nIn Britain, the government passed the Family Allowances Act in 1945, which provided financial assistance to families with children. The Act was part of a broader package of social reforms introduced by the Labour government after the war, which included the establishment of the National Health Service and the expansion of the welfare state.\n\nThe increased responsibility and decision-making power that women gained during the war led to a growing desire for greater political representation and autonomy. In many countries, women's rights movements gained momentum in the aftermath of the war, as women demanded greater equality in the workplace, in education, and in politics. In the United States, for example, the Women's Rights Movement of the 1960s and 1970s built on the foundations laid by women's experiences during World War II, leading to significant advances in women's rights and opportunities.\n\nThe expansion of government support programs during World War II set the stage for the development of comprehensive welfare states in many Western countries in the post-war period. These programs recognised the government's responsibility to support its citizens and provide a safety net for those in need.\n\nThe impact of war on women's roles in society and the expansion of government support programs was a gradual process that spanned centuries. Each conflict, from the Thirty Years' War to World War II, brought new challenges and opportunities for women, as they were forced to step into roles traditionally occupied by men, both in the short term due to prolonged absences and in the long term due to the loss of life.\n\nWomen took on roles in industry, agriculture, and the military, as well as in the household and the community. They became breadwinners, decision-makers, and leaders in their own right, challenging traditional gender roles and laying the groundwork for future advances in women's rights and opportunities. Women also made significant contributions in the fields of science, technology, and innovation, demonstrating their capabilities and challenging stereotypes about women's roles in society.\n\nFinally, it is worth emphasising that World War 1 and World War 2 were total wars that were very close together in time and thus in cumulative impact. It is more helpful to think of them as one continuous war that was interspersed with periods of social unrest, ranging from the Great Depression to extended civil wars in much of Europe. Society never had a chance to recover. By the time these wars were over citizens in the West were used to the government telling them what to do and to provide for them in ways that had never existed before.\n\nPart 3: Women stepping out of the home and the government stepping in\n\nThe evidence presented by History Future Now in Part 1 demonstrates the staggering loss of young men's lives across various conflicts spanning centuries. Part 2 illustrated the profound consequences of this loss on society, as women were forced to adapt and take on new roles and responsibilities in the aftermath of each war.\n\nThe vacuum left by the absence of husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons had far-reaching implications that transformed the fabric of society over time. Women stepped into the roles of men in the workplace and political arena, and the state took on the responsibilities of the husband and father. This is what we will turn to next, in Part 3.\n\nOne of the most significant changes brought about by the loss of young men in conflicts was the increased participation of women in the workforce. As the shortage of male labourers became more acute, women were compelled to fill the void, taking on roles that had traditionally been occupied by men. This shift challenged long-standing gender norms and gave women greater economic autonomy. The pattern of women entering the workforce in unprecedented numbers was consistently observed across multiple conflicts, from the Thirty Years' War to World War II. Over time, the cumulative effect of this change led to a profound transformation in the perception of women's roles in society and a gradual erosion of the traditional male-dominated workforce.\n\nThe political landscape was transformed as women, who had taken on more responsibilities and leadership roles in the absence of men, began to demand greater rights and representation. The women's suffrage movement, which had been gaining momentum prior to many of the conflicts discussed, was further fuelled by the experiences and needs of women during and after these wars. Women's increased participation in the political arena can be seen as another instance of women stepping into roles traditionally occupied by men. The cumulative effect of women's increased political participation and the challenges to traditional power structures brought about by the loss of young men in conflicts led to significant shifts in the balance of power and the rise of new political movements.\n\nAs women took on more responsibilities in the workforce, the state also began to fill the vacuum left by the loss of male breadwinners. Governments expanded support programs to assist war widows and their families, effectively taking on the role of the husband and father by providing financial assistance and social support.\n\nSupport for war widows eventually morphed into support for single mothers. This growth of the welfare state represented a significant shift in the relationship between citizens and their governments, as the state increasingly assumed the responsibilities previously held by male providers. The cumulative impact of these changes over time led to a greater dependence on the state for basic needs, raising questions about individual autonomy and social cohesion.\n\nAs women stepped outside the home and into the paid workforce, the state began to step in to provide support for children and families. The establishment of nursery care, preschools, and before- and after-school clubs became increasingly common in the post-war period, particularly in countries with high levels of female employment.\n\nIn many European countries, governments began providing subsidised childcare as part of efforts to promote gender equality and support women's participation in the workforce. The expansion of state-funded education and childcare services can be seen as a direct response to the changing roles of women in society, with the state taking on some of the traditional responsibilities of the mother in order to facilitate women's increased participation in the workforce and public life.\n\nAs the state took on a greater role in providing support for families and individuals, the concept of the \"nanny state\" began to emerge. This term refers to a government that takes an overprotective or excessively interfering approach to its citizens' lives, often through regulations and policies aimed at promoting health, safety, and well-being.\n\nExamples of nanny state policies might include mandatory vaccination programs, regulations on food and drink (such as sugar taxes or bans on trans fats), or laws requiring the use of bicycle helmets or seatbelts. The provision and increased expectation that the government will provide free school meals to primary and secondary school children is another sign of the government stepping into the role of the parent.\n\nWhile these policies are often well-intentioned, they have also been criticised for infringing on personal freedoms and individual responsibility. The rise of the nanny state can be seen as a natural extension of the state's increasing role as a surrogate parent and provider in the wake of the societal upheavals brought about by war and the changing roles of women.\n\nFathers have traditionally been associated with providing discipline at home. When children misbehaved, mothers could threaten them with the thought of being punished when father came home. However, the absence of fathers, or the abdication of responsibility by fathers who are present, has led to a significant decline in paternal discipline.\n\nThis breakdown in discipline is having serious consequences for society. According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, the percentage of public school teachers who reported that student misbehaviour interfered with their teaching increased from 36 percent in 1987-88 to 43 percent in 2011-12. Furthermore, a 2019 report by the National Association of Elementary School Principals found that 68 percent of principals reported an increase in disruptive student behaviour over the past five years.\n\nThe decline in paternal discipline, combined with the increasing emphasis on compassion over discipline in schools as more women enter the teaching profession, is exacerbating this problem. This lack of discipline in childhood is now extending into adulthood, contributing to a rise in anti-social behaviour, crime, and a general lack of respect for authority.\n\nThe increased participation of women in the workforce and political sphere has been accompanied by a shift towards more compassionate and nurturing approaches in these domains. As women have taken on leadership roles in business and government, they have often brought with them a greater emphasis on empathy and collaboration.\n\nThis shift can be seen in the rise of corporate social responsibility programs, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and family-friendly workplace policies. In the political sphere, women have been at the forefront of efforts to address issues like child welfare, support for refugees and immigrants, education, and healthcare, bringing a more nurturing and compassionate perspective to these debates.\n\nThe increased compassion in work and political life can be seen as a reflection of the traditional nurturing role of women in the family being transferred to the public sphere, as women have taken on more prominent roles in these domains.\n\nIn addition to the increased participation of women in the workforce, governments also turned to mass immigration as a means of replacing the lost male population. This influx of immigrant men helped to fill the labor shortages caused by the wars and played a significant role in reshaping the demographic and cultural landscape of many countries.\n\nThe demographic shifts and changing family structures resulting from the loss of young men in conflicts, combined with the influx of immigrants, led to significant changes in the traditional family structure and a greater diversity in relationships.\n\nAs women were increasingly drawn into the workforce, the question of who would take on the traditional roles of women in the household became more pressing. The answer, in part, came in the form of labor-saving devices and technological advancements that reduced the burden of housework.\n\nThe introduction of appliances like washing machines, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators in the early to mid-20th century significantly reduced the time and effort required for household chores. These technological advancements, coupled with the rise of convenience foods and ready-made clothing, made it easier for women to balance work and home life, effectively replacing some of the traditional roles of the mother in the household.\n\nThe widespread availability of birth control in the mid-20th century had a profound impact on women's lives and the structure of the family. The ability to control fertility gave women greater autonomy over their bodies and their life choices, allowing them to delay marriage and childbearing in order to pursue education and career opportunities.\n\nThe use of birth control also led to a significant decrease in family size in many developed countries. This shift towards smaller families had significant implications for women's roles and the allocation of household responsibilities. With fewer children to care for, women were able to devote more time and energy to their careers and personal pursuits, further challenging traditional gender roles and expectations.\n\nThe decreased emphasis on the family as the central unit of society can be seen as both a cause and a consequence of the changing roles of women in the wake of war and societal upheaval. As women gained more independence and opportunities outside the home, the traditional family structure began to lose its primacy, leading to a de-emphasis on family life and a greater focus on individual fulfilment.\n\nAs women and society as a whole became increasingly reliant on government support, it became more difficult for citizens to hold their governments accountable. This growing dependence on the state has the potential to undermine the democratic process, as people were less willing to challenge or criticise a government upon which they rely for their basic needs. Furthermore, the state's increasing role as a surrogate husband and father raises concerns about individual autonomy, as citizens may become more dependent on the state for their well-being and decision-making.\n\nThis has helped move political parties increasingly to the left. The more support they offer, the more people vote for them. Unfortunately, this largess cannot be funded by taxation alone, which explains the significant amount of national debt accumulated by most Western countries since the end of World War 2.\n\n( A big parenthesis here: It is important to note that the societal changes described above may not have affected all countries in the same way. In Muslim countries, for example, the practice of polygamy and the cultural tradition of marrying the widows of deceased relatives may have helped to mitigate some of the demographic and social consequences of the loss of young men in conflicts. As a result, these societies may have been able to maintain, or even enhance, a more traditional family structure and gender roles in the face of war-induced population losses. Is this hypothesis true? This is something worth pursuing in another History Future Now article.)\n\nThe consequences of the loss of young men in conflicts, as evidenced in Parts 1 and 2, necessitated women stepping into the roles of men in the workplace and political arena, while the state took on the responsibilities of the husband and father.\n\nPart 4: Conclusion- The Unintended Consequences of War and an Uncertain Future\n\nLarge scale wars don't just cause the death of millions of people. They don't just cause terrible suffering and pain. They don't just cause the destruction of families and communities. They don't just cause the destruction of centuries worth of art and architecture. Those are just the short term impacts.\n\nAs this article has shown, large scale conflicts fundamentally alter the fabric of society. They have forced women to step into roles traditionally occupied by men and this, in turn, has led to the rise of the state as a surrogate husband and father.\n\nSome will celebrate this. Death to the patriarchy!\n\nHowever, as women entered the workforce and political arena, the state expanded its reach, providing support and assistance to families and individuals through welfare programs, education, and healthcare. This shift in the balance of power between the sexes and the growing dependence on the state had significant implications for individual autonomy and the traditional family structure.\n\nAs women have taken on more traditionally masculine roles, the state has also begun to encroach upon the remaining spaces traditionally occupied by women, particularly in the domestic sphere. The rise of the nanny state, with its increasing involvement in child-rearing, nutrition, and personal health decisions, has led to a further erosion of the traditional family structure and the roles of both men and women within it.\n\nMoreover, the rapid advancement of technology, including in the form of artificial intelligence and robotics, is now threatening to displace both men and women from their traditional roles in the workplace. As machines become increasingly capable of performing tasks previously done by human workers, the question of what role individuals will play in society becomes ever more pressing. What is their role if the government is now both husband and wife, mother and father, and there is no work to be done?\n\nThe cumulative effect of these transformations has been a profound sense of unease and uncertainty, as the traditional pillars of society - the family, gender roles, and work - are increasingly called into question. We all can feel that there is something wrong. Life does not seem to make sense anymore.\n\nAs we grapple with the challenges posed by these societal shifts, it is essential that we recognise the interconnectedness of war, gender roles, technology, and the state. The lessons of history, as illuminated by the analysis of History Future Now, serve as a stark reminder of the unintended consequences that can arise from the upheaval caused by war and the changing roles of men and women in society.\n\nThe Long Term Impact of Covid 19",

      "full_text": "In an online article about the youth unemployment crisis in Europe and Africa HFN asked a question: \"What are all these people going to do?\" to which a reader responded:\n\n\"If you look on the street, you'll find the answer ... countless uprisings in most European countries will finally generate a profound revolution that will change Europe!\n\nAt this point each one is focused on the problems of his country, but soon will realize that the problems they face are generated by the same source... that will be the moment when they begin to seek each other using social media tools.\n\nFrom that point on things will get out of control, and the events will happen with extreme violence and at breakneck speed\"\n\nThis raised a fascinating question: \"What does it take to get Europeans to have a revolution?\"\n\nIn this article, History Future Now looks back at the European revolutions over the past few hundred years to find out. It quickly becomes apparent that the concept of \"revolution\" needs to be pretty broad and must encompass other aspects of civil unrest and violence, including protest marches, riots, uprisings and civil wars.\n\nWhat we will uncover is what is needed to get Europeans out of a state of inertia, where they accept the status quo, into a state of action, where they risk their lives and property to do something about a situation that is unacceptable. We look at the causes of these civil unrests and then will ask final, more important, question: do any of these circumstances exist today and can we expect a revolution at some point in the future?\n\nWhat follows is a turbulent ride through history, looking at the main revolutions, civil wars (which can be seen as unsuccessful revolutions), protests that resulted in change (which can be seen as revolutions were avoided) and riots. We will travel through these revolutions in a chronological order. The reason for this approach is that historical context is critical in understanding the causes of revolutions. Revolutions in one country have a significant impact on the counties around it. Revolutions rarely happen in historical or geographic isolation. What may surprise readers is the sheer number of revolutions and civil wars that have taken place over the past few hundred years in Europe alone. Over 60 in total.\n\nThere are very strong overlaps for all of Europe's revolutions. The motivations were similar in the past and are likely to be similar in the future.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nEnglish Civil War / English Revolution\n\nThe English Civil War, or English Revolution, which kicked off in 1642, is perhaps the most important of all revolutions in modern European history. What took place here provided the blueprint for many revolutions of the future.\n\nUltimately, the English Civil War was a struggle for control over the country. On one side you had Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland, who wanted to rule the country without interference from Parliament. On the other side you had Parliament, which, by long tradition and law, was supposed to have significant influence over the governing of the country, including over the raising of taxes, but had been ignored and had its power circumvented by King Charles I.\n\nBefore any reader gets carried away thinking that this was about democracy vs monarchy, think again. Parliament was the representative body of the rich and the powerful. Not the common man. The English Civil War was paid for by Parliament on one side, which offered a reasonably reliable salary to the toiling classes who would become their soldiers, and the King on the other side, who became unable to pay his soldiers. He lost.\n\nParliament was fed up with being ignored and decided to fight the legitimate ruler of the country for control. Parliament won. Eventually the King was beheaded and Parliament took over. But Parliament was not sure about what to do after it had won: their initial war aims had been simply to get the King to share power with them, as he was legally obliged to do.\n\nIn the end, Parliament handed over power to their commander in chief, Oliver Cromwell, who had led the Parliamentary side to victory. Ironically, he ended up wielding more personal power than Charles I had ever held.\n\nParliament was not happy with this and after Cromwell's death they invited Charles' son back to England to restore the monarchy with a clear understanding that he would rule in conjunction with Parliament and not as a divinely appointed absolute monarch. Faced with a choice of permanent exile or becoming king, albeit with strings attached, Charles' son agreed to their demands. In 1660 the monarchy was restored and Charles II was proclaimed King.\n\nSo the lesson of the English Civil War was not that the English were particularly keen on getting rid of the monarchy. Rather it was that the upper middle class, who controlled Parliament, were fed up of being ignored by the monarchy and wanted a real voice and real governing power. That was enough.\n\nThe Glorious Revolution\n\nUnlike the English Civil War, this 1688 revolution, which was instigated by Parliament against James II, King of England, Scotland and Ireland, was not about control today, but fear about a loss of control in the future. The Glorious Revolution was essentially a preemptive Parliamentary first strike.\n\nThis revolution, which took place within the living memory of many of the participants of the English Civil War, was as a result of Parliament becoming unhappy with the religious persuasions of the monarch, King James II. King James II, a Roman Catholic, had succeeded his brother, Charles II, a Protestant, in 1685. James II was becoming increasingly supportive of Catholics in a country that was defiantly Protestant.\n\nFor the first few years of his reign the Protestant dominated Parliament could live with James II's Catholic leanings in the knowledge that his heir, Princess Mary, was very Protestant. In June 1688, however, everything changed when James' Catholic second wife gave birth to a son, Prince James. Inevitably the new heir apparent would grow up a Catholic and would, as an adult, attempt to roll back Protestantism.\n\nSo Parliament invited James II's son in law, William of Orange, a Protestant Dutchman, to invade the country and to overthrow the King. William was married to Mary, James II's daughter. In November 1688 William landed in England with a large invasion fleet and, after two minor clashes, successfully took over the country. James II fled into exile with his wife and baby son.\n\nParliament initially only wanted William to become Regent, with Mary governing as Queen. When William threatened to return to the Netherlands in disgust, Parliament reluctantly agreed that he should be a co-monarch with Mary. They were crowned King William III and Queen Mary II. To prevent any potential Catholic power grab in the future a series of laws were enacted that made life increasingly difficult for Catholics. Many still exist today.\n\nSuperficially, this looks like a revolution about religion. It is hard for modern secular Europeans to understand conflicts about religion, especially doctrinal differences between Roman Catholicism and the myriad of Protestant sects. Fortunately, we can skip the differences and get to the point: if you were a Protestant with a Protestant monarch you would be okay. If a Catholic came to power you might lose your lands, titles and power, or even your head.\n\nSo Parliament was not really fighting a civil war about religion. They had risked everything when they fought Charles I and had beheaded him. They had invited Charles II back to be king on their terms. They were not about to throw it all away by allowing a Catholic king and heir to impose Catholicism on them.\n\nSo the lesson of the Glorious Revolution is that the upper middle classes of Britain, those that controlled Parliament, would fight to keep their wealth and their power and would pre-emptively strike out at a monarchy that might want to reduce their wealth and power.\n\nJacobite Risings\n\nThe English Parliament had kicked out James II in 1688 and had replaced him with his son-in-law and daughter, William of Orange and Mary II. Between 1688 and 1746 a series of rebellions took place with the intent of restoring King James II to the throne. After the death of James II in 1701 his son was proclaimed King James III by his supporters and was backed by King Louis XIV of France and Pope Clement XI.\n\nIn 1702 William III died - his wife Queen Mary II had died in 1694- leaving no children. Mary's sister, Anne, became queen. Despite having had an amazing 17 children none survived to adulthood. So when she died in 1714 Parliament arranged for the Protestant Elector of Hanover, Georg, to become the new King, George I.\n\nSo it is easy to see why the Jacobites (from the Latin Jacobus - James) felt that their chosen ones, James II and James III, had a much better claim to the throne than William, Mary, Anne and George I. Much of the action took place in Scotland and the borders between England and Scotland, providing a lot of the \"Scottish\" colour that is associated with the rebellion today.\n\nBut despite a lot of rebellions over a long period of time, it is hard to describe this as a popular revolt. Essentially it was another power struggle. This time between Parliament and their chosen monarchs (William, Mary, Anne, George) and the usurped House of Stuart (Charles I, Charles II, James II and his son).\n\nSo the lesson of the Jacobite Risings was that the upper middle classes of Britain, who ran Parliament, had fought a Civil War and, had instigated a coup d'etat with a foreigner to depose of a potentially troublesome monarch, would fight to keep their power.\n\nAmerican Revolution\n\nThe American Revolution, which started in 1775, was a British revolution on American soil. There were thirteen British colonies in America. These colonies were governed by British laws, and its people were British.\n\nMany of these colonists had left England before, during and after the English Civil War, depending on how their side was doing in the conflict. Puritans from East Anglia had settled New England between 1629 and 1640 in the run up to the English Civil War. Between 1642 and 1675 a large number of aristocrats and their supporters from the south and west of England fled to Virginia and Maryland. Between 1675 and 1715 another wave of immigrants, mainly Quakers from the north of England, settled in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. Finally, between 1717 and 1775 another wave of immigrants, from the north of England, lowland Scotland and Ulster, moved to Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Kentucky.\n\nWhat they all had in common was the knowledge that the monarchy was not a superior power that had to be obeyed. These people had seen their king, Charles I, beheaded. They had seen England develop a republican Commonwealth with power held by Parliament, with no monarch at all, under Cromwell. They had seen Parliament choose five monarchs: Charles II, William III, Mary II, Anne and George I.\n\nIt can be argued that the American Revolution was a rehash of the English Civil War. The colonists had grown up with an understanding that Parliament was the key to governance and power in England. Charles I had been deposed because he had been governing the country without any Parliamentary representation for years. And yet the problem was even worse for the British colonies in America. They had no Members of Parliament at all.\n\nIn many respects this was a practical problem. It took a long time to travel to London from the colonies. American Colonial Members of Parliament would be away from home for months at a time and would be deciding on matters that had nothing to do with issues in North America. Only some issues would be directly relevant to them. No other part of the British Empire had overseas Members of Parliament either.\n\nIn addition, it must be mentioned that the colonists did have provincial assemblies that had much higher levels of electoral representation than their fellow citizens back in England, Scotland and Ireland. Only 17-23% of adult males could vote for the British parliament. In contrast, about 75% of adult males could vote in American provincial assemblies, which dealt with issues that were directly applicable to them.\n\nThis was not enough. What the colonists objected to was a lack of control. Politicians in another, distant, country were making rules and setting levels of taxation on them, all without the consent of the American provincial assemblies.\n\nBritish citizens in America fought back to take all of the rights that they had come to expect in Britain, without compromises. The British had fixed the colonies' western border in 1763. After the revolution the colonies could head west, uninterrupted. The British controlled all exports and fleets. Now colonial ships could trade (almost) where they wanted. The British had imposed taxes, albeit very low ones, on the colonies. Now the colonies could control their own taxation.\n\nCritically, full sovereignty now lay with American citizens. This helps to explain why America today is so reluctant to tie itself to international agreements that supersede American law. It also explains why so many British today rile against the European Union, which places the British Parliament in a position of subjugation not that different from American provincial assemblies to British Parliament prior to 1775.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that it was not guaranteed that America would become a Republic, once victorious. Many thought that George Washington should become their new monarch and wanted to confer on him far more powers than he would ultimately take. Had another man led the Revolutionary efforts America might well have ended up being another monarchy.\n\nSo the lesson of the American Revolution was that wealthy British citizens in America would fight to gain the same rights that were enjoyed by their fellow citizens in Britain.\n\nFrench Revolution\n\nIt is terribly ironic that the French monarchy, under Louis XVI, was a major supporter of the British colonists' bid for independence in 1775 - 1783. Only six years after the colonists won, in 1789, France was ripped apart by one of the most violent revolutions in history. Louis XVI, who only came to power in 1774, was executed in 1792.\n\nUnlike Britain, which had seen a gradual transfer of power from the monarch to Parliament over centuries, France still maintained a very strong centralised autocratic monarchy. Louis XIV, who ruled France for an impressive 72 years until his death in 1715, had famously said \"L'etat, c'est moi.\" (I am the state). He personified the state and was an absolute, divinely ordained monarch with full control. Louis XIV was threatened by the Parliamentary antics of the English to his north, which was why he was a supporter of the Jacobins and aimed for the restoration of James II and then James III.\n\nIn reality, the French monarchy shared power with another major group: the Roman Catholic Church who ruled a state within a state. They were the largest single landowners in the country, owning about 10% of the land and they were exempt from paying any taxes.\n\nIt was lack of money that set the stage for the French Revolution, in a similar way that the lack of money set the stage for the English Civil War. France was in deep financial trouble, partially due to the losses during two major periods of conflict. First, the Seven Years War of 1754 -1763 which was a world war involving all the great European powers and ranged from Europe, North America (where it is known as the French and Indian War), Central America, West Africa, India and the Philippines. Second, was the American Revolutionary War, during which France saw the opportunity to weaken its British rival by cutting it off from its increasingly wealthy American colonies. In the first conflict France lost. In the second conflict France won but gained nothing, and still bore all the costs.\n\nTo resolve the financial crisis Louis XVI called for an assembly of the Estates-General in 1789. This was a major step. The last time this assembly had been called was in 1614. 175 years previously. He needed the Estates-General to gather together because he needed a broad agreement on comprehensive tax changes. The church and nobility needed to be taxed and the commons needed to get on side.\n\nSo what was the Estates-General? There were three parts. Each part had one, equal, vote. The First Estate was the clergy. The Second Estate was the nobles. The Third Estate was the common people.\n\nBut by convening an assembly of the Estates-General Louis XVI had inadvertently opened a Pandora's Box. In the spring of 1789 elections were held for the Third Estate and French males over 25 who paid taxes were allowed to vote. 610 Third Estate members were elected in total. But nobody could agree on the mechanics of voting for the Estates-General. So in June 1789 the Third Estate declared itself as the National Assembly and invited members of the clergy and nobility to join them, which many did. The new National Assembly then proclaimed that they would not disband until they had drawn up a new constitution for France.\n\nBy this stage Louis XVI had completely lost control of the situation. By calling for the Estates-General to be assembled and by permitting the Third Estate to hold elections he lost legitimacy. By July many Parisians believed that the king was bringing in foreign mercenaries to disband the National Assembly and they stormed the Bastille Fortress on the 14th July to capture the large cache of weapons and ammunition. Civil authority deteriorated and militias began to emerge throughout France. Meanwhile, the National Assembly worked towards creating a new constitution and in August 1789 published a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nThe situation in France was rapidly deteriorating and the Catholic Church, who had effectively shared power in France, came under attack. In November Church property was confiscated, \"handed over to the nation\" and by early 1790 all religious orders were dissolved. Many senior army officers, who had formed part of the nobility, deserted and fled to other parts of Europe. In June 1791 the King and his wife tried to slip out of the country, dressed as servants. They were discovered at the border and dragged back to Paris where they were kept under guard.\n\nBy September 1791 the king had accepted a new position as a figurehead in a new constitutional monarchy. This did not form a lasting solution and in the following year the monarchy was abolished and a Republic was declared. Within weeks France was also at war with its neighbours who had threatened to invade if the king was deposed. Unfortunately for Louis, this made him an enemy of the state and he was put to death by guillotine on the 21 January 1793.\n\nThe entire French state became militarised to a level that had never previously existed anywhere. All men and women were involved in fighting against outside, anti-revolutionary, forces. Despite initial losses, French revolutionary armies were incredibly successful against all of the other powers that it confronted.\n\nThis concept of total war was applied internally and externally. As France was set upon by outside forces, a reign of terror began within France. Anybody deemed to be against the new state was eliminated, with the egalitarian execution machine - the Guillotine - being used extensively.\n\nThe French Revolution differed from the English Revolution and Civil War in its speed and its scope. What had started off as a reasonably good idea by Louis XVI to call an assembly of the Estates-General in 1789 rapidly devolved into chaos and death. Unlike the English Revolution, which affected relatively few people, and was fought by armies involving a few thousand soldiers, everybody in France was touched. The revolution lasted until 1799 when Napoleon became first dictator and then Emperor in 1804.\n\nSo what was the French Revolution really about? Clearly as the king had been executed and a republic had been declared it had something to do with a power struggle between a newly elected elite and the monarchy.\n\nIt was also about pulling France out of a Middle Ages time warp. An absolute monarchy and a hugely powerful church made no sense in 1789. The French could see how successful Britain and America had become over the past decades. The British way of governing seemed to be more enlightened. Better.\n\nSo the lesson of the French Revolution is that French citizens were fed up with bad government that kept them both poor and unable to do anything about their fate. When they were given the opportunity to have power, (thanks to Louis XVI's fatal call for the Estates- General to be assembled, permitting direct democratic elections by qualified French men), they seized the opportunity and revolted.\n\nIrish Rebellion\n\nFor five months in 1798 Ireland was shaken by an odd alliance of Protestants and Catholics who rebelled against British rule. The Irish Rebellion had been inspired by both the American Revolution and by the French Revolution. French revolutionary forces actually landed in Ireland in August 1798 to help the Irish followed by another attempt to land a larger force in October 1798 which was intercepted by a Royal Navy fleet.\n\nFrom 1607 onwards Irish Catholics had been banned from holding public office, or serving in the army. In 1641 there had been an Irish Rebellion. The English Parliament put this rebellion down using loaned funds from financiers, called \"Adventurers\". Under the 1642 Adventurers Act, the major Catholic landholders in Ireland had their lands confiscated. These lands were then granted to the Adventurers in payment, to either sell off or hold.\n\nFurther anti Catholic and Irish legislation was enacted and sometimes repealed. This included exclusions from voting, a ban on intermarriage with Protestants, exclusion from legal professions and the judiciary, a ban on foreign education, a ban on conversion from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism, a ban on Catholics inheriting Protestant land, a ban on Catholics teaching, etc. Britain had embarked upon a long-term policy of discrimination against Irish Catholics in particular and the Irish in general.\n\nSo what was going in on Ireland was quite different from all of the Revolutions that we have discussed previously. The English Civil War was predominantly about the English fighting the English (though it actually had a relatively large Irish and Scottish component to it). The Glorious Revolution, whilst ostensibly a Dutch invasion, was also about English fighting English. The Jacobite Risings mainly took place in Scotland and the North of English, but was a power struggle between the Parliamentary chosen monarch and an exiled hereditary monarch. The American Revolution was another power struggle with the British on both sides of the conflict. The French Revolution was about French fighting French.\n\nIn Ireland it was about the Irish fighting a foreign power group that had continuously behaved in an appalling manner against its Irish subjects. However, we should not look at this through modern eyes. \"Foreign\" rule was quite normal for the time. In the 18th century most of Europe was ruled by family \"houses\", or dynasties. Louis XVI, for example, was of the House of Bourbon and was the King of France and King of Navarre, now part of Spain. George III was of the House of Hanover and was the King of Britain (English and Scottish kingdoms had merged under the Act of Union), King of Ireland and King of Hanover.\n\nSo to describe the Irish Rebellion as an attempt to throw off the British yoke is anachronistic. The concept of 'national identity' was relatively new and really started to emerge after the French Revolution and only seriously took hold after the First World War with Woodrow Wilson's ill advised, and much regretted by him, statement that peoples had the right to \"self determination\". This statement would trigger countless revolutions in the 20th century.\n\nThe Irish had been crushed by the British and so they had very little to lose, except their miserable lives, and a huge amount to gain by Rebellion. They were ultimately unsuccessful at this time though changes in legislation over the coming decades would make their lives less intolerable.\n\nSo one of the Irish lessons must be that if you push a people too far and discriminate against them because of who they are, and allow foreigners in their midst to take their lands and wealth then you should expect a revolt.\n\nSerbian Revolution\n\nSerbia is a country with a pretty unhappy history, mainly due to its terrible geographic location. It is located in south eastern Europe, with Hungary to the north, Romania and Bulgaria to the east, Macedonia and Albania to the south and Montenegro, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west. Thus it sits at the crossroads between Germanic invaders heading south into the Roman Empire, and Orthodox Christian Byzantine and the Roman Catholic West and then the Ottoman Turks and the increasingly powerful Austro- Hungarians. For much of the time between 1394 and 1817 Serbia was fought over by the Ottoman Turks and the Hungarians and then the Habsburgs. Only on occasion was it independent.\n\nBy the early 1800′s Serbs were convinced that they no longer needed to be subject to foreign rule. The Habsburgs had occupied much of Serbia between 1788 and 1791 and had recruited their fellow Christians against the Muslim Ottomans. The French Revolution had shown the Serbs that it was possible to topple even a powerful monarchy and by 1805 France, under Napoleon, ruled most of the lands to the west of Serbia, bringing revolutionary ideas right next door. Meanwhile Russia, a fellow Slavic and Christian Orthodox country, had become increasingly assertive and had pushed back the Ottomans from its own southern border.\n\nBetween 1804 and 1817 there were two Serbian Uprisings against the Ottomans. During the First Serbian Uprising demands for self-government gradually morphed into a war for complete independence from the Ottomans. Belgrade was captured and became the capital of an \"independent\" Serbia. The Ottomans fought back, massacred many Serbs and sold others into slavery. In 1815 a second Serbian uprising occurred, which was ultimately successful. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, a newly resurgent Russia put sufficient pressure on the Turks to allow Serbia to become a semi-independent Principality, under Ottoman rule. Within a generation this semi- independent status morphed into full independence and the Kingdom of Serbia was created in 1882.\n\nThere are a number of lessons from the Serbian Revolution. First, historical context is critical. The American, French and Irish revolutions showed the Serbs that the status quo could be changed. Napoleon's charge across Europe to as far as Egypt had shaken many powerful countries, including the Ottomans. Revolutionary Serbs could point to neighbouring countries and say to wavering supporters - look, even giants can be slain.\n\nSecond, the families that ruled Europe were losing their monopoly on power resulting in the rise of nationalism as a way of creating a self-identity. Serbs were Orthodox Christians speaking a Slavic language. The Ottomans were Shia Muslims speaking a Turkic language. The only thing they had in common was a ruling family that favoured its Muslim Turkic people over everyone else. That was unfair.\n\nA supranational state, which these ruling families essentially represented, needed to provide equal opportunities for all of its citizens. Favouritism towards the ethnic group that had brought you to power inevitably locked in inequality.\n\nHad the British allowed rich American colonists the ability to become full Members of Parliament, despite the obvious logistical issues, and allowed both Catholic and Protestant Irish full equality in a state that had no official religion (which by its existence discriminates against those who do not adhere to the official religion) then it is highly unlikely that there would have been a Revolution in America or Ireland. The same applied to the Ottomans. Had they upheld no official religion and allowed all of its subjects full access to rights then the elites in all of their jurisdictions would have felt no reason to rebel.\n\nThe rich have far more in common with international rich than they have with the poor of their own nationality which helps explain why London's massively inflated house prices today as the international rich flock to it.\n\nThis was the secret to Imperial Rome's success until it went down the path of adopting Christianity as the official religion. Rome originally allowed ALL its citizens access to power and after the Julio-Claudian dynasty few emperors actually came from Rome. Emperor Constantine's concept of one God, one Emperor and one Empire sounded good in principle. In practice it excluded all who did not believe in the one official God. And that was a lot of people. Which resulted in a lot of conflict.\n\nGreek Revolution\n\nAs has been shown with the recent revolutions in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, revolutions can be contagious. After the fall of Byzantium in 1453 most of Greece, like Serbia to the north, fell under Ottoman rule.\n\nInterestingly, the Greeks had fared reasonably well under Ottoman rule; much better than had the Serbs. Constantinople had been a target of Ottoman attacks because it was such great city. The Byzantines, heirs to the Roman Empire, were very sophisticated and educated. Many Greeks held senior positions within the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAfter the successful Serbian Revolution, however, the Greeks decided to have a go against the Ottomans as well. A war of independence broke out in 1821 and officially lasted until 1832.\n\nGreece was supported in this revolt by Russia, the United Kingdom and France, all of whom held romanticised ideas about Greece. The English poet Lord Byron and French painter Delacroix helped to provide fantastic PR for the Greeks. This romanticism translated into huge financial support to assist the Greeks in their revolt ( the London Philhellenic Committee, for example, provided about GBP 3m) and also diplomatic and military support. The French, British and Russians all lined up in support of the Greeks, despite the fact that many of the supporters were fearful that independence movements might backfire and result in bids for independence amongst their own far flung territories.\n\nBy 1828 the Ottoman rule over Greece was effectively over. In the next four years the great powers of Russia, France and Britain negotiated a Greek settlement and went about choosing a monarch for the country. Eventually they chose a Bavarian Prince, Otto of the Wittelsbach dynasty. He reigned until he was forced to abdicate in 1862. He was succeeded by George I, who was born Prince William of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the son of the King of Denmark and a German princess. German and Danish royal family members ruled Greece until the abolition of the monarchy in 1973.\n\nClearly, there were significant overlaps with what had occurred with the Serbian Revolution. Both were Greek speaking Orthodox Christian people in a world dominated by Turkic speaking Shia Muslims. The impetus to rebel was very similar.\n\nThe Americans received a lot of French help in their revolution against Britain. The Irish received a lot of help from the French too. The Serbs received help from the Russians. The Greeks, however, had outside help on an unparalleled scale. Greece had the advantage of being a relatively small country dominated by an increasingly weak power, the Ottomans, and attracted the support of a series of great powers that had recently become enamoured with ancient Greek history and literature. They were lucky.\n\nSo what are the lessons of the Greek revolution? Firstly, their reason for having the revolution, the lack of power by the native elites, was pretty standard. Second, being a \"charismatic\" country helps a great deal when seeking support from powerful external allies.\n\nTwo more French Revolutions\n\nThere were so many French Revolutions after the \"classic\" revolution of 1789 that it is almost hard to keep count.\n\nOne occurred in July 1830, the July Revolution, and another in June 1832, the June Rebellion, sometimes called the Paris Uprising. (For those that have read the book, watched the film or seen the musical \"Les Miserables\" it was the June 1832 Rebellion that took center stage).\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 the victorious powers reinstalled the Bourbon dynasty onto the throne of France. The French Republic was no more. The 1830 Revolution resulted in a new monarch, but not a new republic. The 1832 Revolution was completely unsuccessful and the King, Louis Phillipe I, survived as king until another revolution, the 1848 Revolution, which brought back the Republic.\n\nIt is worth noting that Britain's time as a parliamentary commonwealth - a republic in all but name- lasted significantly longer than the short lived French Republic. However, the concept of Republicanism had affected far more French citizens than British ones.\n\nIn the aftermath of Louis XVI's execution in 1793 all of the nations around France ganged up on it, fearful that republican sentiment would spread beyond France's borders. The new republic responded by conscripting pretty much the entire nation. This was very unusual. Warfare prior to this period had been restricted to relatively small armies controlled by elites. During the English Civil War, for example, battles would be fought with between 5-10,000 soldiers on each side.\n\nFrench Republican armies were huge. Superior numbers were the only way that the French had a chance at standing up to the array of angry monarchies and empires that attacked it. One of the reasons Napoleon was so successful was that he inherited these huge armies and wielded them in a groundbreaking way. When Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 it was at the head of an army of 450,000- an unbelievably huge army compared to armies just a decade or two earlier. He once said that he could lose 30,000 soldiers per day. That was the size of an entire army prior to the French Revolution.\n\nThe Russian, Prussian and Austrian ruling elites that opposed him were terrified of arming their own citizens in equal numbers as they were concerned that their citizens would rise up in revolt against them. Yet they had no real choice. They were forced to increase the conscription of ordinary citizens into their own armies. Eventually they won.\n\nDespite the fact that France had returned to a monarchy after the republican revolution, the people of Europe had had a glimpse of life under a republic. Once the republican genie was out of the bottle it could not be put back.\n\nThis synopsis helps to explain the huge rise of populist revolutions in the 1800s. Ordinary citizens had both seen political power and had been trained to fight.\n\nOne of lessons of the Revolutions of 1830 and 1832 was that once a people realised that it was possible to have a revolution and win, it would be more likely to revolt again in the future. Another lesson was that it is particularly stupid of a government to try and reintroduce the power of the church and the aristocracy. That was why the Revolution in 1830 took place and Charles X was deposed.\n\nThe Revolutions of 1848\n\nWe now arrive at the greatest year of revolutions in European history until the collapse of communism in 1989. There were revolutions in Italy, France, Prussia, Denmark, the Habsburg Empire, Switzerland, the Ukraine, Poland, the Danube, Belgium, Ireland and Brazil.\n\nSome of these revolutions were nationalist - a reaction against being ruled by foreigners. This was partially the case in the Italian states, which would eventually reunify to form modern Italy, in Schleswig where Germans revolted against Danes seeking to fully integrate Schleswig into Denmark, in Hungary, riling against the Habsburgs, in the Ukraine where Ukrainians revolved against the Habsburgs, in Poland, where Poles revolted against the Prussians and in Ireland where the Irish revolted against the British.\n\nA second reason was a change in the social make up of European societies.\n\nLiving conditions on rural farms were bad and in 1845 and 1846 a potato blight caused near famine like conditions in much of continental Europe and Ireland (where it was called the Great Irish Famine). The subsequent starvation resulted in a lot of emigration from Europe to America and from rural areas to rapidly growing industrial cities, especially in France and Prussia.\n\nYet living conditions in cities were terrible for most of these economic migrants. Unskilled workers had to work for very long hours in dangerous conditions. Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, which describes life during the run up to the 1832 French Revolution, shows how harsh life could be. The concentration of people helped spread ideas of republicanism and socialism and so it is not surprising that people revolted against the inequality that they saw all around them.\n\nLife in an industrialising Europe was really terrible for most people. We forget this today. The value of labour dropped precipitously as high fertility levels increased the overall size of the population and mechanisation removed the need for many old jobs. Those who had capital made a lot of money. Those that did not lived through several generations of abject misery.\n\nIn France the 1848 Revolution was successful and Louis Phillipe I, who had narrowly escaped being dethroned in 1832, was booted out. A short-lived Second Republic was declared. In Austria and Hungary serfdom - where labour was tied to the land and could be bought and sold - was abolished. In Denmark the absolute monarchy accepted a new power sharing constitution, which helped to keep them in power, though in a diminished form.\n\nSo what are the lessons of the 1848 revolutions? First is that nationalism - a desire not to be ruled by foreigners who had other agendas- remained strong in most countries. Second, industrialisation introduced a new dimension to politics. Large numbers of poor people concentrated into cities could result in riots and revolutions that were hard for authorities to contain.\n\nNo Revolution in Britain 1848\n\nBefore we move on, why was there no revolution in Britain in 1848? Most of the other big European states had one.\n\nFirst, it is worth highlighting that Britain had not been conflict free in the years running up to 1848. Between 1811 and 1817 there had been a series of Luddite riots. Workers had gone on the rampage, destroying factories and industrial equipment such as lacemaking machines and power looms. Much of this work had previously been artisanal and had provided additional income for farmers and people in rural areas. The government was so concerned by this civil upheaval that a Frame Breaking Act was passed in 1812 which introduced the death penalty for these crimes. New factories had destroyed jobs faster than they could be created. Factories had resulted in higher levels of unemployment, which in turn, reduced the value of labour for those that did have jobs. That made them vulnerable to exploitation by factory owners. If they complained they would be fired and join the ranks of the unemployed.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1848 a new working mans' movement, the Chartists, developed. Their main aim was to widen and deepen Britain's democratic participation.\n\nUltimately the Chartists were unsuccessful in pushing their agenda, due to issues with leadership as much as anything else, and the movement fizzled out in 1848, just when the rest of Europe was in rebellion.\n\nIt is also worth noting that British exports eventually helped to improve the lives of British workers. Because Britain had industrialised first it held a comparative advantage in many fields of industry. It's products were cheaper and better than everybody else's. This meant that British factories did not just produce goods that undercut British artisanal workers but also undercut artisanal workers in every other country as well. India's cotton and weaving industry, for example, was crushed by the onslaught of cheap, high quality, British goods. As demand for cheap British goods increased overseas the value of British factory workers increased, resulting in higher wages which enabled them to benefit from the cheap products they were producing, and benefit from better working conditions, as factory owners competed for their workforce and more sophisticated labour organisation pushed for legislation that protected workers.\n\nSo what can we learn from Britain's lack of revolution in 1848? Core to Britain's resistance to revolution was political legitimacy. Britain's weak constitutional monarch and strong parliament meant that citizens who had reasonable wealth and influence could become part of the political elite, either in the lower House of Commons or in the upper House of Lords. Those that had the power to influence and fund revolutions were already in power. Why bother revolting? Second, Britain had home rule. There was no higher, foreign, authority that they had to defer to on critical questions of sovereignty.\n\nThese two factors, plus a political system that listened, at least vaguely, to the poorer working class meant that Britain was flexible enough to adapt to change, rather than to break.\n\nLots of Revolutions 1850-1916\n\nWe need to speed up and get to the modern era before we can start to look to the future. There were a lot more revolutions and rebellions over the next 50 years. The causes were pretty similar, those of nationalism and lack of political power.\n\nThey include:\n\n- 1854 Rebellion in Spain\n\n1854 Rebellion in Spain\n\n- 1859 Second Italian War of Independence\n\n1859 Second Italian War of Independence\n\n- 1863 Polish uprising against Russian rule\n\n1863 Polish uprising against Russian rule\n\n- 1867 Irish Feinan uprising against British rule\n\n1867 Irish Feinan uprising against British rule\n\n- 1868 Glorious Revolution in Spain that toppled Queen Isabella?\n\n1868 Glorious Revolution in Spain that toppled Queen Isabella?\n\n- 1871 Paris Commune after France's crushing defeat by Prussia\n\n1871 Paris Commune after France's crushing defeat by Prussia\n\n- 1875 Herzegovinian rebellion against the Ottomans\n\n1875 Herzegovinian rebellion against the Ottomans\n\n- 1875 and 1876 Bulgarian uprisings against the Ottomans\n\n1875 and 1876 Bulgarian uprisings against the Ottomans\n\n- 1903 Macedonian uprising against the Ottomans\n\n1903 Macedonian uprising against the Ottomans\n\n- 1905 failed Russian Revolution\n\n1905 failed Russian Revolution\n\n- 1907 Romanian peasants revolt\n\n1907 Romanian peasants revolt\n\n- 1910 Portuguese Revolution establishing a republic\n\n1910 Portuguese Revolution establishing a republic\n\n- 1916 Irish War of Independence\n\n1916 Irish War of Independence\n\nRussian Revolution of 1917\n\nWe are nearly at the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War that started in the summer of 1914. Four years later, near the end of this terrible and unnecessary war, on the 16th July 1918, Russia's imperial family was executed by a new set of revolutionaries the Bolsheviks, later referred to as Communists.\n\nFor most of the 1800s Russia was an unsophisticated backwater. But under Tsar Nicholas II, who came to power in 1894, the country started to emerge as a major European economic power. By early 1914 Germany began to worry that within a few years Russia's larger population, combined with rapid industrialisation and an improved railway network, would make her unbeatable in the event of a war. Curiously, France had the same concern about Germany. Germany, which had emerged on the world stage as a unified nation only 40 years before, after the Franco-Prussian War, which France lost, now had a larger population than France and a stronger industrial base.\n\nWithin a few years, France feared it would never beat Germany. Thus both France and Germany preferred to have a war sooner, rather than later.\n\nGermany, encircled by potentially hostile nations on all sides, rightfully feared for its existence. Bismarck, one of history's finest statesmen, had managed to keep all of Germany's enemies on the back foot. After he had been dismissed, none of his successors were capable of maintaining the web of alliances necessary to protect Germany. Russia and France ended up forming an official alliance. So when Germany became embroiled in its own ally's war, that of Austro-Hungary against Serbia after the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the throne in Sarajevo in June 1914, it quickly found itself in a terrible dilemma. Russia formally supported Serbia. Germany formally supported Austro-Hungary. Thus if Austro-Hungary went to war with Serbia, Russia would come to its aid, forcing Germany to come to Austro-Hungary's aid. Which meant that France would come to Russia's aid and Germany would be attacked on both sides.\n\nThis was a bad position for Germany.\n\nFortunately, Germany had a brilliant strategist, von Schlieffen, who devised a plan in 1905 to allow Germany to first attack and then defeat France within 42 days, before Russia was able to respond and attack eastern Germany. With France defeated and the western front secure, Germany would then turn on its larger enemy to the east and defeat Russia.\n\nEasy.\n\nIt did not quite end up that way. Russia mobilised first and faster than expected. French resistance was more resilient than expected. And then there was Britain. Britain, unexpectedly, declared war on Germany.\n\nThe German Kaiser and the English King were cousins. The English royal family was German, from Hanover. They had defeated France together in 1815. France was England's historic enemy. France had no formal military alliance with Britain. Britain was a naval power. Germany was a continental power. They could have been perfect allies. The problem was that Prussia and Britain had signed an agreement in 1839 to ensure the independence of newly created Belgium. The von Schlieffen plan called for Germany to bypass France's fortifications and transit through Belgium on its way to France. Since Belgium refused to allow German soldiers to transit freely through its lands Germany triggered the Belgium neutrality agreement and Britain found itself legally obliged to go to war with Germany.\n\nWhile Germany got stuck in France, it did brilliantly against the Russians. Arguably had Germany not invaded France and had just attacked Russia, and only put up resistance against France in the west, France would never have had British and American help in defeating Germany. The western front would have remained a stalemate and Germany would be victorious in the east. There would have been no world war and Germany would have probably won.\n\nSo what does this have to do with the Russian Revolution?\n\nBy October 1916 Russia had lost nearly 5 million men in all, 2 million men killed, 2 million prisoners of war and 1 million missing. These losses were deeply destabilising to the country. In February 1917 things had gotten worse and a revolution broke out in Petrograd. Workers went on strike and the soldiers that the Tsar ordered to quell the rebellion mutinied. His army chiefs and remaining ministers recommended that he abdicate, which he did. No one wanted to succeed him and so the country fell to a provisional government, which put him under house arrest.\n\nNow history gets really strange.\n\nThe head of the Bolshevik party, Vladimir Lenin, was in exile in Switzerland. German officials calculated that if Lenin were to return to Russia at this time he would be able to foment a revolution, which would lead to Russia's pulling out of the war. Germany's eastern front would be secure and it could then put all its attention back to defeating France and Britain in the west. Lenin was transported back in a sealed train, so that he would not foment revolution in Germany along the way, and he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917. By September 1917 there were 200,000 Bolshevik party members, a ten-fold increase from a few months previously. In October, feeling that there was enough Bolshevik support, Lenin kicked off a second, major revolution. In November the Bolsheviks called for a cease-fire on all fronts and, after the French and British refused to go along with this, Russia unilaterally declared a ceasation of hostilities on the eastern front in December 1917. 900,000 German soldiers were switched from the eastern to the western front. Germany's gamble with Lenin had paid off.\n\nOf course, this was not the end of the story. The following year Russia descended into Civil War and it took a number of years before the Bolsheviks were fully in control over the country.\n\nSo what are the lessons of the Russian Revolution.\n\nFirst, even a big country, like Russia, could fall to a revolution. It was under significant stress. Millions of its soldiers were dead, POWs or missing. Its government appeared weak and its ruler's legitimacy had been weakened by the traumas of war.\n\nSecond, the circumstances of the birth of communism were extremely rare and might never have happened. A lot of events had fall into place for the revolution to take place. There was no reason to suggest that the Russian Revolution needed to be a communist revolution. The Provisional Government was not communist. It could well have resulted in Russia turning into a Republic, rather like circumstances after the 1789 French Revolution. It was Germany's deliberate injection of the communist virus, Lenin, into Russia that changed the outcome of the Russian Revolution. Lenin was deadly effective. The initial, successful, revolution had been hijacked by a secondary revolution.\n\nThird, the communist virus had found a major power to become its first host. Communism cried out for world revolution. It was not good enough for one country to become communist. Everybody needed to be socialist. This meant that Russia would actively try to promote socialism in other countries. This was different, other nationalist revolutions did not have the aim of fomenting nationalist revolutions in other countries. It was closer to a new monotheistic religion.\n\n1918 Revolutions\n\nIt was not just Russia that was convulsed at the end of the First World War. Most of the major powers were critically damaged. The only real victor was the United States, who had arrived late, after Germany was starving and almost on its knees, much as they were to do in the Second World War.\n\nThe defeated were really defeated. Royal families were toppled, countries dismembered and huge swathes of territory were reallocated to new countries. The unequal and unjust peace would make a Second World War almost inevitable.\n\nMuch of the cause of this dismemberment was thanks to a speech given by the American President, Woodrow Wilson, on 8 January 1918 wherein he explicitly called for the peoples of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire to break free of their masters. Essentially this was the same trick that the Germans used on the Russians. For European subjects of Russia, Germany and Austro-Hungary this was a very welcome statement and they prepared themselves to take advantage of this new sentiment of self-determination.\n\nA month later, he expanded on his 14 Points speech and declared that \"National aspirations must be respected; people may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent. Self -determination is not a mere phrasal it is an imperative principle of action.\"\n\nWilson's allies, who dominated and governed huge swathes of the earth without the consent of its peoples, were shocked. Wilson's Secretary of State was also shocked. America had many overseas possessions, ranging from Puerto Rico, Hawaii to the Philippines.\n\nGermany\n\nBy July/ September 1918 Germany's military leadership became convinced that defeat was imminent. Ludendorff, who famously had led an insane, but successful, night assault against the Belgian fortresses of Liege at the outbreak of the war and was now head of the Army, told the Kaiser that French and British forces would break through the western front within days. Peace feelers were sent out and when they were rebuffed German forces started to mutiny. The Kaiser was persuaded to abdicate and on 11 November 1918, Armistice Day, a cease-fire was declared and the war was effectively over.\n\nGermany became a Republic and a civil war ensued over the next few years as factions, including the Communists and the prototype Nazi party fought each other.\n\nAt the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on 28 June 1919, Germany was carved up, with millions of ethnic Germans ending up as minorities in newly created countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia, and was forced to pay huge reparations.\n\nAustro-Hungary\n\nAustro-Hungary suffered a very similar fate. By October 1918 a provisional government of German-Austria was established. At the end of the month a new democratic republic of Hungary officially dissolved the union with Austria. On the 11th November the Emperor Charles I of Austria abdicated and a day later a German-Austria Republican government came into being. Shortly after, newly established countries of Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia emerged from the rump of Austria.\n\nWhile Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, Austria-Hungary formally signed a separate agreement in September 1919, the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which recognised all of the territorial losses that had taken place over the past few months. Like Germany, it was forced to pay reparations and had significant restrictions placed on the number of its military personnel.\n\nOttoman Empire\n\nIf you think Austria and Germany had a raw deal after the end of the First World War, it was nothing compared to the radical dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. In October 1918 an armistice was signed between the Allied powers and the Ottoman Empire, bringing the war to an end.\n\nOver the next few years the Allies systematically pulled the country apart, resulting in the establishment of an independent Republic of Turkey, run by Mustafa Kemal (Attaturk) in 1923. New countries were created and were generally run by either the French of the British.\n\nSo what are the lessons from the 1918 Revolutions?\n\nFirst, is that all of these new republics came about as Germany, Austro-Hungary and the Ottoman Empires were about to collapse. In many respects this was a repeat of what had happened in the previous year to Russia. The Habsburgs and Ottomans were family dynasties who ruled over many subject peoples who were not of the same ethnic, cultural or even religious background, not in itself the problem. The problem was that the Habsburgs and Ottomans favoured their own people over their subject people. And that caused resentment.\n\nSecond, like the Greek Revolution, these newly independent countries could not have occurred without the support of the big, victorious powers. This support came either indirectly, via Wilsonian declarations of the rights of self-determination, or directly as in the case of Allied military intervention in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nLots more revolutions\n\nWe are now going to jump ahead until the next major group of European revolutions, which took place in 1989. The major event after the First World War was the Second World War, which resulted in the partition of Europe into US and Soviet spheres of influence from 1945. There were occasional uprisings against Soviet rule, such as the 1956 Hungarian uprising, and Portugal, Spain and Greece which had been under dictatorships, reverted to democratic rule in the mid 1970s. In Northern Ireland the Irish continued their struggle against the British.\n\nThe Revolutions of 1989-1991\n\n1989 was a big year for change in Europe. Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Albania all saw relatively peaceful transitions from communism to democratically elected governments. Germany reunified. Romania's revolution was more brutal. Czechoslovakia would break into two in 1992 and Yugoslavia would break into many bits. In 1991 the Soviet Union was dissolved, resulting in a huge number of new countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe collapse of communism is complicated, and worthy of a separate chapter in its own right. Since we are primarily interested in the lessons to be learned, we will cut to the chase.\n\nFirstly, we know from previous revolutions that the domination of one group of people by an outside power is a cause for resentment and frequently a trigger for revolution. Communist Soviet Union controlled its citizens on a massive scale.\n\nSecondly, Communism did not provide free access to power for all of its citizens. If you were part of the communist party you were fine. If you were not, then you had no access to power or legitimacy.\n\nThirdly, people in Communist countries gradually could see that the West had a higher standard of living. Communism kept people poor. And people resented that. In East Germany, for example, it was possible to see fellow Germans in West Germany enjoying a better life. Shooting East Germans who tried to escape to the West did not inspire confidence that Communism was a better solution to that of democratic capitalism.\n\nRecap\n\nSo lets have a recap looking at the Revolutions so far. What have we learned?\n\nOne lesson is that a lack of equal access to power by parts of society is deemed unfair and will frequently result in revolutions. This lack of access can be further split into two parts: that of social inequality within an ethnic group; and one of ethnic inequality between two or more ethnic groups.\n\nThe following revolutions were basically ones of social inequality within a country. One social group had power and wealth, such as a monarchy or dictatorship, and another larger social group wanted access to that power (though not necessarily for others lower down the social ladder). There are 24 European revolutions that fall into this category, which include:\n\nThe English Revolution of 1642, Glorious Revolution of 1688, American Revolution of 1775, French Revolutions of 1789, 1830, 1832 and 1848, the Spanish Rebellion in 1854, Glorious Revolution in Spain in 1868, Paris Commune of 1871, Russian Revolution of 1905, Portuguese Revolution of 1910, Russian Revolution of 1917, German Revolution of 1918, German-Austrian Revolution of 1918, Portuguese, Spanish and Greece overthrow of dictators in mid 1970s, and Communist Revolutions in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Albania in 1989.\n\nThe next batch of revolutions are also about the inequality of power, but in these cases it was one ethnic or national group who held a discriminatory, near domination, power over one or more other ethnic or national groups. There are 39 European revolutions in this category, which include:\n\nThe Irish Rebellion of 1798, Serbian Revolution of 1804, Greek Revolution of 1821, European wide revolutions of 1848 in Italy, France, Prussia, Denmark, the Habsburg Empire, Switzerland, the Ukraine, Poland, the Danube, Belgium and Ireland, Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, Polish uprising against Russia in 1867, Herzegovinian rebellion against the Ottomans in 1875, Bulgarian uprisings against the Ottomans in 1875, Romanian revolt of 1907, Irish War of Independence of 1916, Austro-Hungarian Revolutions of 1918 resulting in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Kingdom of Serbia, Croats and Slovenes, Hungarian uprising, and the creation of new countries after the fall of the Soviet Union on 1991 - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n\nA second key lesson is that revolutions are contagious, but not necessarily about the same issue. The early revolutions, in England, America and France were all inter-related. The French Revolution was heavily responsible for the creation of the modern state and modern conscript army. This had huge ramifications across Europe in the revolutions of 1848, some of which were driven by social inequality issues and others by ethnic inequality issues. The collapse of Germany, Russia, Austro-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I set off another huge wave of revolutions. Finally, the collapse of Communism in 1989-1991 triggered another wave of revolutions.\n\nBoth of these latter waves of revolutions combined ethnic and social inequality issues.\n\nPart 3: Today and Tomorrow\n\nMost revolutions start with protests or riots and if these insurgencies are sufficiently strong compared to the ruling authorities they can then turn into revolutions. Some of these revolutions will be fully successful and will change the government; some will result in a civil war where neither party is strong enough to prevail, and some will be crushed and die out.\n\nIt is for this reason that the various protest groups and riots that have happened over the past few years are so fascinating from a historical perspective. In North Africa and the Middle East many of these riots turned into successful revolutions that have toppled the government. In Syria the revolution failed and the country has fallen into a civil war. Since we have established that revolutions are contagious, the successful revolutions in North Africa have helped inspire many of the rioting groups in Europe and vice versa.\n\nSo where have the recent European riots and protests been? Lets look at some examples.\n\nSpain 2011\n\nThe Spanish demonstrations started in May 2011 in Madrid and dozens of other cities, right before local and regional elections.\n\nSpain's riots are not ethnic inequality driven. There is no foreign ruling class. It is a social inequality problem. The unemployment rate in Spain is extraordinarily high, with over 50% of young people under 25 without a job. This means that they lack access to the basic rights of a job and an income that they can be proud about. They have been excluded by society and none of the political parties have a good answer to their problem. As so many are on unemployment benefits austerity measures, needed to try and balance Spain's budget, hit them directly. The Sinde law in February 2012 also affected young people - this allowed the government to close down websites that show or allows for the illegal downloading of copyrighted content such as music and films. Since young people are more likely to be both poor and want to download illegal content this directly affected them and was seen to protect corporations at the expense of the people. The discovery of widespread political corruption at the very top of Spain's government did much to solidify the view that older, richer, parts of society were getting more than their fair share.\n\nGreek Protests 2010\n\nIn May 2010 Geeks rioted in protest to plans to cut public spending and raise taxes as part of austerity measures imposed to stop Greece from falling into a financial crisis. Papandreou, the Prime Minster, told the country that there would be more public sector pay cuts, pension reductions, new taxes on company profits, more taxes on cigarettes and alcohol and a higher level of VAT. This helped Papandreou secure an IMF and EU loan.\n\nMany of the protests were initially peaceful but some deteriorated into violence, especially in Athens. In May of 2011, following the Spanish protests and riots, more rioting broke out. At the end of June there were violent clashes between riot police and protestors as parliament voted to accept EU austerity measures.\n\nIn February 2012 as many as 500,000 protestors gathered outside the parliament building in Athens to protest against more EU and IMF imposed austerity measures. 45 buildings were set on fire. A few weeks earlier there were two 24 nationwide general strikes called by Greece's two largest labour unions.\n\nUnited Kingdom 2011\n\nIn March 2011 a demonstration organised by one of the country's largest trade unions, the TUC, resulted in 500,000 protestors marching in London. There were similar protest marches in Manchester, Perth, Liverpool, Leicester, Ipswich, Bristol and Edinburgh. On June 30th, a one-day strike was held by public sector workers angry about cuts to pension plans and retirement policies. In November 21,000 schools were closed due to strikes.\n\nThe causes were similar to those in Greece and Spain - protests against austerity measures and coupled with a general perception of unfairness.\n\nOccupy Movement 2011\n\nThe Occupy movement was originally a US protest against the increasing wealth disparity in society. Inspired by the Arab Spring and protests in Spain and Portugal it soon spread to over 95 cities in 82 countries.\n\nOne of the key slogans was \"We are the 99%\" - a reference to the huge concentration of wealth held by the top 1% of income earners.\n\nWhy has there been no revolution?\n\nDespite the fact that much of Europe has faced large protest marches and riots since 2010 no country, so far, has fallen to revolutionary forces. What do these protests and riots have in common with the past, and what is different.\n\nOne thing that they have in common is that this is a widespread movement and spans many countries. This was the same during the 1848, 1917-19 and 1989-1991 pan European revolutions.\n\nAnother factor is a sense of social injustice. As Europe gets relatively poorer more people, especially the young, are excluded from the work place and lose hope for the future. Europe's citizens are looking for someone to blame.\n\nA final factor is a sense that many of these problems are caused by foreign influences. Bankers in particular are targets of vitriol - they are seen as aloof and their international nature makes them appear to be foreign oppressors. Effigies of the German Chancellor are frequently burned in Greece as they point to Germany's dominance of the EU as the cause for harsh austerity measures.\n\nSo the European protests have much in common with the causes of revolutions in the past but also some key differences.\n\nFirst, social revolutions in the past had clear distinctions between \"them\" and \"us. A monarchy, an aristocracy, the church are all very identifiable. They lived in distinctive buildings, wore distinctive clothing and were distinctly an identifiable enemy. Communists had separate buildings, had special offices and special privileges. But today the differences are far more muted. It is not clear, exactly, whom people are rebelling against. Thousands of public sector employees were going on strike against their own government. Politicians are relatively easily removed from office, during elections, but it is not clear why you would vote for another party instead. They are too similar.\n\nSecond, while there is a 'foreign' inequality element to these protests, it is also very muted. It was clear to the citizens of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires who were the foreign oppressors. They wore different clothes, spoke a different language, worshiped a different god. Today foreign oppression comes in the form of the EU and international bankers. But there is no EU state. There is no banking state. They don't live somewhere different to ordinary citizens. The enemy is amorphous.\n\nThird, governments now are reasonably good at adapting to change. A monarchy or communist or military dictatorship could be relatively aloof, and thus out of touch, from normal people. Because they have been democratically elected they are more in touch with citizens than governments were in the past. This gives democracy both legitimacy and flexibility.\n\nFourth, earlier European societies were more familiar with military organisations. Today, most young Europeans have had no military experience at all. After the French revolution, war broke out across most of Europe.\n\nYoung men were called up and conscripted to fight in France, Prussia, Russia and elsewhere. That helped set the stage for the 1848 revolutions. The 1917-19 revolutions came on the back of the First World War where most young men had also been trained and organised to fight. The 1989-1991 revolutions were started by people who had been subjected to decades of military conscription, thanks to the Cold War. They were trained to fight and to be organised. Most young people today were born after the collapse of communism. The nearest they have to fighting experience is on their PlayStations and Xboxes. From a government's perspective having a conscript army is a dangerous thing as people are more likely to rise up against the government than to be used in fighting another country.\n\nFifth, the welfare state provides a significant buffer against inequality and poverty. Young people may hate being unemployed, but they do have a meagre income from the state. They can usually live at home and are not forced on the street. A lot of entertainment is cheap and accessible - especially illegal downloaded content onto cheap laptops and tablets.\n\nFinally, social media makes it very easy to spontaneously call for a protest march or a riot. Getting people out on the street is the easy part. The problem is that this also makes it very difficult for leadership to emerge. All successful revolutions in the past had some form of leadership. Leadership is needed in order to persuade people to join a protest, to tell them where to go, what to do and what to protest about. Leaders needed particular skills, like charisma, personal bravery, risk taking, great timing and diplomacy to get large numbers of people to revolt and then to form an effective government to replace the one that had been overthrown.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo does that mean that you won't see any revolutions in Europe in the future?\n\nNot so fast. A certain number of things could change, making a revolution more likely.\n\nFirst, governments can overreact and thus make themselves a much clearer target for opposition groups. If they become more rigid they are more likely to break. Killing a few rioting protestors is a sure way to galvanize the opposition. Revolutions love martyrs.\n\nSecond, strident efforts by the EU, a supranational body, will galvanize support against the EU. It is easy for national politicians to redirect anger against them onto the EU and they will. This increases the chance of a country deciding to leave the European Union.\n\nThird, many young European Muslims are and have been fighting alongside Muslim brethren during the Arab Spring. The injustices of the Arab world are shared by many young Westerners, though the targets of their anger are quite different. These sympathisers bring back radical ideas, practical organisational skills and military experience.\n\nFourth, many European budgets are at breaking point. As more young people stay unemployed their ability to pay income taxes is effectively nil. Many others are in dead end jobs that pay little and thus provide little tax revenue for the country. The only people who can pay are the rich locals and rich foreigners. They are likely to be subject to very high levels of taxation. They will respond by hiding their assets. Ultimately this will be a world with less tax income and greater demands. Something has to give. Unemployment benefits, state sector salaries and pensions are likely to be cut. This will create a pool of very angry, hard up citizens.\n\nFinally, there is no real revolutionary leadership today. But that may change. The Russian Revolution in 1917, for example, was hijacked by the Bolsheviks under Lenin. Social media today means no real leadership. But it could equally be harnessed by a core group of revolutionaries who have a clear agenda that is well communicated.\n\nAnd that might be enough for Europe to have a successful revolution.\n\nA Frozen Society: The Long Term Implications Of NSA's Secrets",

The conclusions will alarm many people.\n\nImmigration that crushes the indigenous population.\n\nNeanderthals\n\nMuch has been written about the disappearance of Neanderthal man, a species of human that lived, successfully, in Europe for over 200,000 years. This is an unimaginably long time. They survived multiple ice ages proving that they had a very high capacity to adapt. Neanderthals had larger brains and were significantly stronger than modern humans.\n\nYet they vanished around 20,000 years ago. Their disappearance coincided with the disappearance of other ice age mega fauna, such as woolly mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses, and with the appearance of our own species of human, Homo Sapiens. For decades the working assumption was that Homo Sapiens drove Homo Neanderthalensis into extinction, either killing them outright or out competing them for resources. More recent evidence, using reconstructed Neanderthal DNA, suggests that these two groups were successfully able to breed and that many modern Europeans have up to a 3% overlap in DNA with Neanderthals. Whether they were killed, lost their lands and died or were bred out of existence is intellectually interesting but the fact remains that Homo Sapiens, who came out of Africa much later, exist today and Neanderthals do not.\n\nFrom a Neanderthal perspective the immigration of Homo Sapiens did not end well.\n\nIndigenous Europeans and Indians\n\nOver the past ten years a new form of archaeology has emerged called paleogenomics which allows historians and geneticists to look at the migrations of ancient peoples prior to recorded history. Paleogenticists use a related but more sophisticated method of mapping family trees that people today can buy from companies such as www.ancestry.com to trace their own personal genetic heritage.\n\nBy tracing the male XY and female XX chromosomes of people living in Europe, Iran and North West India and Pakistan paleogenticists have been able to look back at who was living where over ten thousand years ago. What they discovered was a holocaust.\n\nMost History Future Now readers will be aware that English is an Indo European language, a family of languages which includes nearly all European languages, such as the Germanic, Greek, Slavic and Romance languages, as well as the languages of North West India, such as Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Punjabi. About 3.2 billion people speak an Indo European language today, making it the largest linguistic group in the world.\n\nThe idea that these languages were linked was first put forward by an English priest and linguist living in India in 1583 who noted the similarities between Latin, Greek and Sanskrit. This was followed up in 1786 by another English linguist called Sir William Jones who spent more time classifying and reconstructing the connections between the various languages From that time it became widely accepted that for these languages to be connected there must have been an original group of people who spoke the language, which linguists called Proto Indo European or PIE for short. Archaeologists and linguists then spent most of the next two centuries coming up with theories of the location of the original homeland of the PIE speaking people, which is now determined to be in the regions north of the Caucus mountains. They left their original homeland between 10,000 and 4,000 years ago.\n\nArchaeologists and linguists have speculated that the combination of the wheel and horses allowed Proto-Indo Europeans to expand rapidly outside of their homeland and penetrate most of Europe and North West India. For a while the theory was that this movement was a cultural and linguistic change - as Proto-Indo Europeans brought superior technologies to other areas peoples in those areas adopted the Proto Indo European culture, centred around the horse and wheel chariots. This is a similar impact to the Europeans moving to Africa and Southern Asia in the 1700-1800s - the cultures may have changed but the underlying peoples remained intact.\n\nWhat paleogenticists discovered was far less benign. The DNA evidence shows that this was not a peaceful transfer of culture but rather that Proto Indo Europeans aggressively invaded Europe and North West India. The evidence shows that the male line of the indigenous peoples collapsed while the native females became the mothers of children fathered by Proto - Indo European males. The most likely explanation is that the native males were killed in massive numbers and the native women were forced - likely raped- to have children with the men who had killed their husbands, fathers and sons.\n\nFrom the perspective of indigenous Europeans and Indians, the immigration of Proto Indo Europeans did not end well.\n\nRomans\n\nIn 376 AD a group of Germanic people, called the Goths, were pushed out of their native lands and arrived on the banks of the river Danube. The Romans on the other side of the river were used to such groups arriving. A large part of their army was now made up from recruits from Germanic tribes who had settled in the empire in previous decades.\n\nThe Roman Empire had grown rapidly on the back of territorial conquest. Each victory over new barbarian tribes resulted in a huge, one off, transfer of wealth from the conquered people to the Romans. Slaves and treasure kept the economy going and kept its professional army loyal.\n\nAs Rome ran out of worthwhile adversaries military conflict changed from being a boost to the economy to being a major burden. Victories in foreign lands did not recoup the cost of war and constant attacks from German tribes into the Roman Empire itself meant that even a Roman victory was a financial loss. Worse still, Roman defeats resulted in the loss of property, enslavement of Roman citizens and the payment of huge ransoms to keep the barbarians from attacking again. Which they invariably did.\n\nBy 410 barbarian tribes were roaming freely within the core of the Roman Empire. Vandals and Visigoths travelled through Gaul and Hispania (settling for a while in V andalusia) before crossing the Straights of Gibraltar and taking over the valuable grain producing lands of Roman controlled northern Africa. Central control was lost and the Roman Empire in the west, always poorer relative to the Greek dominated Eastern Roman Empire, crumbled, to be replaced by chaos and warlords.\n\nFrom a Roman perspective Germanic immigration did not end well.\n\nVisigoths\n\nIn 711 an army of Muslim horsemen and foot-soldiers successfully crossed the Straights of Gibraltar into the Christian Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania, in what is now southern Spain. Internal infighting meant that there was very little to stop their advance and they marched all the way to the Pyrenees. They crossed this mountain range and were stopped by the Frankish king Charles the Hammer (Martel) in 732. They retreated across the mountains and would then dominate all of Spain. The indigenous Spanish (whoever they were, they had previously been invaded by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans and the Germans) were forced to convert to Islam or lose their properties and their possessions. Many were killed or went into exile. The reversal came in 1492 when the reinvigorated Christian armies of Isabel and Ferdinand captured Granada, ending Muslim rule.\n\nFrom the perspective of the indigenous Spanish Muslim immigration did not end well. From the perspective of the Muslim ruling class the Christian re conquest did not end well either.\n\nTaino\n\nIn 1492 the geographically challenged Genoese navigator Cristoforo Colombo arrived at a small island in the Bahamas, rather than his intended destination of China or Japan. Unimpressed by the evident lack of Asian wealth that he had been expecting, he seized on the tiny amount of gold worn by the Taino natives (forever known, erroneously, as Indians) as proof of the tremendous wealth waiting to be exploited. Had he actually arrived in China he and his small band of Europeans would have had no military advantages over the Chinese. Instead, he brought guns, steel armour and swords, horses and old world disease - including smallpox, which helped to wipe out much of the Taino population. Most died and the remnants were enslaved. By 1519 nearly the entire indigenous population of the island was dead. The indigenous population was eventually replaced by immigrant African slaves.\n\nFrom a Taino perspective European immigration did not end well.\n\nAmerican Indians\n\nIn 1890 the US frontier was officially closed, the continent was crisscrossed by railways and Europeans dominated the North American continent.\n\nEnglish settlement in North America did not start off well. The first English colony of Roanoke disappeared without a trace in 1590. Subsequent colonies suffered terrible hardships that were only endurable by those who believed they were doing God's will. Unlike in South American colonisation, which was primarily driven by the resource exploitation of locals commanded by Spanish males, in contrast English colonisation was dominated by family groups. These families had many children and the English population grew rapidly, to the detriment of the indigenous population.\n\nAfter the American Civil War new waves of family groups from other European countries, such as Ireland, Italy and Eastern Europe, arrived. These immigrants made life for the indigenous American Indian population even harder. After the Wounded Knee Massacre in December 1890 the remaining native population was relocated to special reservations.\n\nFrom a Native American perspective European immigration did not end well.\n\nImmigration that topples an elite, but leaves most things unchanged.\n\nNext, we have examples where the indigenous population may lose control but is sufficiently populous and robust that they can co-opt the incoming immigrant population.\n\nAncient Greeks\n\nGreece today is a tiny country and is an economic basket case. This is a sad state to be in for a country that was once one of the most vibrant powers in the world. Most people know of Alexander the Great (technically a Macedonian not a Greek) and his conquests of all of the eastern Mediterranean and lands as far as Afghanistan and India. You may also be aware of the Roman Republic's take-over of these Greek dominated lands, including those of Greek ruled Egypt, under Cleopatra. What is forgotten, however, is that the Roman occupation of Greece, modern Turkey and the entire eastern Mediterranean was an occupation of predominantly Greek lands.\n\nThe Romans became heavily indebted to Greek culture. The elites all spoke and read Greek. Their children were taught the language by Greek slave tutors. Their origin myths and religion were heavily reliant on Greek archetypes. Even Christianity was Greek, the New Testament was written in Greek, not Latin. Judaeo-Greek thought dominated its pages, not Roman thought.\n\nThroughout the Roman Empire the eastern, Greek, part was always the richest and most influential. When Emperor Constantine created his new capital, Constantinople, it was in the heart of the richest part of the empire. Latin was not the primary language it was Greek. And when the empire was split in two, to help to govern such a huge area, it was the western, Latin, part of the empire that fell first. The Greek Eastern Roman Empire, later known as Byzantium, lasted all the way until 1453 almost 1,000 years later. Then it was finally crushed by the Muslim Turks.\n\nGreek culture and language survived because it was sophisticated and its population was larger than that of the Roman immigrants. Clearly the Roman invasion was not great for the Greek elites. But Roman immigration did not result in the end of the Greeks as an ethnic and cultural powerhouse. That job was left to the Ottomans.\n\nAnglo Saxons\n\nIn 1066 England was invaded by Harold Hardrada, the King of Norway, and Tostig Godwin-son, the rebel brother of King Harold of England. The invasion was repelled. Harold had only recently been crowned king after King Edward, who hated Harold's entire Godwin family, died at the end of 1065. William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy, who had family ties to Edward, claimed that Harold was a usurper and at the end of the summer the country was invaded for a second time. Harold lost (his body so badly butchered that it was unrecognisable by all except his mistress) and William became the Conqueror, King of England.\n\nWhat is interesting is that French-speaking William was actually part Viking. His pagan Norse ancestors had invaded the northern part of the Frankish Kingdom only 150 years previously. They had good Viking names like Hrólfr (Rollo). The invaders had been absorbed by the local population and the fierce sea-faring Norsemen married local women who taught French to their half Norse children. They converted to Christianity and started to give their offspring Christian names such as Robert and William.\n\nAfter the Norman invasion of Britain a similar integrational process occurred. First there was a brief period of French linguistic dominance by the Norman elite at official government levels before they too started to intermarry with the indigenous Anglo Saxon locals. Official documents, previously only written in English, were now written in Latin, which both the English elite and Norman conquerors could read and write. Within a generation, however, English (though by now heavily infused with parallel French loan words- think \"pig/pork\", \"cow/beef\") resumed it's place as both the common language and official language.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Anglo Saxon ruling elite, who saw most of their lands taken away by Norman supporters loyal to William the Conqueror, the Norman invasion was a disaster. For many of the common people it was very harsh as well - much of the north of England in particular was \"harried\" by Norman soldiers and it took generations for them to recover. But a strong Anglo-Saxon core remained.\n\nChinese\n\nChina likes to project the image that it is a country with a long, uninterrupted, history. The reality is quite the opposite. It has been split up into warring kingdoms many times and has been repeatedly invaded by nomadic steppe people from Central Asia.\n\nThe Mongol hordes remain a frightening memory to many Eastern Europeans. During the 1230s and 1240s they were attacked repeatedly by superb Mongol mounted archers who also leveraged local subjugated peoples to provide siege technology to take large cities. But what Europeans forget is that they were attacked by nothing more than a scouting party.\n\nThe Islamic Empire was far more seriously affected and was crushed by the Mongol forces. The fall of Baghdad in 1258, which was the capital of the Islamic Empire, is considered by many historians as the beginning of the end of Islamic dominance of the early medieval world.\n\nHowever, it was China that was subjected to the full brunt and terror of the Mongol armies. The horsemen were fast and could survive off the milk and blood of their mares. This meant that they required almost no supply lines dragged by slow-wheeled vehicles. The Mongols comprehensively crushed the Chinese, slaughtering on a scale that would not be seen again until the Second World War. They established themselves as the new ruling class, the Yuan Dynasty. But China's population remained so big, its culture and language so dominant, that it was the Mongols that were absorbed by the Chinese.\n\nWhile China's culture was to endure, from a Chinese perspective forced immigration from Mongol armies was truly horrific.\n\nIndians and Africans\n\nAfter Britain officially lost its thirteen North American colonies in 1787 it shifted its imperialist attention to other parts of the world. Unlike American colonisation, which was dominated by large family groups, this new empire building process was done by very few people and was more similar to the exploitation model pursued by the Spanish and Portuguese in previous centuries.\n\nBritain's Indian and African colonies started off as trading posts. The trading centers needed to be defended and it was helpful to have control over the local population. Superior European weapons and wealth funded armies of locals who were led by British officers. Over time Britain dominated not just the coast but also all of the lands in the interior. Eventually they were able to create entire nation states out of Africa and dominate huge countries such as India with indigenous populations that were several orders of magnitude greater than the colonial forces.\n\nPragmatic local elites learned English, the language of their masters, and adopted superficial English customs and dress. English law and eventually parliamentary democracy became prevalent. This type of immigration had little to no impact on the ethnic make up of the colonies. Long-standing cultural norms and religions were marginally affected, certainly when compared to mass immigration changes. Arguably British dominance was just a different elite to the old native elite.\n\nDespite the limited ethnic and cultural impact, British colonialism in Africa and South East Asia, and on other European colonialism as well, had huge long-term political ramifications. Almost arbitrary demarcations on the map of Africa resulted in countries being established that were significantly divided from the very beginning.\n\nThus if you look at Africa from an African perspective British and wider European immigration did not end well.\n\nImmigration that is permitted, or encouraged, by the indigenous population\n\nThere does appear to be a third, more modern type of immigration where the indigenous population willingly permits immigrants in.\n\nAmericans\n\nThe early \"permitted\" immigration period probably started with the English in North America. Clearly they accepted more of their own kind across the Atlantic. What is interesting is that they also encouraged the immigration of Africans, to be used as slaves. These immigrants formed very large minorities in many southern English colonies and had a radically different cultural and ethnic background to their English slave masters. The fact that they had been imported as beasts of burden and were barely treated as human has had a multi-generational negative impact on the relationship with Europeans and Africans in North America.\n\nAfter the American Civil War America started to allow other European immigrants into the country. These immigrants predominantly came from Catholic Southern and Orthodox Eastern Europe. Culturally they were quite different from earlier welcomed immigrants, such as the Scandinavians who had settled the Mid West and the Germans and Dutch who had settled parts of the North East. Most were poor when they arrived and poorly educated. They quickly filled the most undesirable posts in society, which also contributed to a multi generational distinction between the Anglo-Germanic \"natives\" and the new incomers. In the run up to the Second World War and in its aftermath large numbers of Jews also made it over to America. Over time, a similarity in culture and Caucasian ethnicity has meant that the Jews have been absorbed reasonably well into the mainstream European culture of America.\n\nIn contrast, however, the attitude of modern day Americans to immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America highlights that even in high immigration countries there is a limit to what is politically acceptable.\n\nPost Colonial British\n\nAs Britain wound up its colonies after the end of the Second World War it wanted to ensure that British subjects who had emigrated to its colonies in the past would be allowed to return home to Britain.. So the Government passed a law, the British Nationality Act of 1948, which gave British Citizenship to all of its colonial subjects.\n\nWhat had not occurred to the legislators at the time was that non-white, non-ethnic British citizens would use this open policy to emigrate to Britain. Which they did. It was during this period that large numbers of immigrants from Pakistan, India, and Jamaica moved over to Britain. In 1962 a new law, the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, was passed, partially closing this unintended loophole. However, since family reunification was still permitted, those immigrants that had established a foothold in the country between 1948 and 1962 were able to bring their family members over. And since those family members had family members of their own they could bring in their extended family members as well. This explains why British immigrants are predominantly from the three countries that used the 1948 British Nationality Act most effectively.\n\nFrance had a similar policy, which explains much of the non-ethnic French population in France today.\n\nThe fact that the British Government changed its immigration policy to stop mass immigration from former colonies speaks volumes about the relative success of this policy and its sustainability.\n\nPost War Germans\n\nUnlike Britain and France, Germany did not have major non-European colonies and so it never had any obligation to allow in immigrants from former colonies. And yet it has a large non-German population that arrived in the post war period. How did this happen?\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s the German economy was booming and it was running out of low skilled labour. Initially it signed up bilateral agreements with the governments of Italy (1955) and Greece (1960), in order to recruit workers on short-term gastarbeiters (\"guest workers\") contracts. Turkey, a key NATO ally during the Cold War, tried to get a similar arrangement in place.\n\nThis approach was initially rebuffed by the Germans as they thought that the cultural gap between Turkey and Germany was too large and that the labour shortage was ending anyway. The US, however, keen to provide as much help to its Turkish NATO ally as possible, persuaded the German Foreign Ministry to change its policy and an agreement was signed between Germany and Turkey in 1961. Similar agreements were signed with Portugal in 1964, Tunisia in 1965 and Yugoslavia in 1968.\n\nWithin a short period of time Turkish gastarbeiters , who mainly came from poor rural areas of Turkey, became the largest immigrant group in Germany.\n\nThis was supposed to be a temporary arrangement with, mostly male, workers allowed to work in Germany for one or two years before returning home. Many did so. Most did not. The gastarbeiter agreement ended with Turkey in 1973 but by that stage workers had settled in the country and had brought their wives and families over. By 2012 over 4 million people, around 5% of the German population, were of Turkish descent.\n\nAs in previous modern examples, the fact that Germany has closed down its mass immigration policy would suggest that countries will follow suit and not willingly allow in large numbers of immigrants with different cultural, religious, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.\n\nTime for a recap\n\nTime for a recap. Looking at the historical record there are three main types of immigration:\n\n- The first type is when a very large group of immigrants come into a territory and take all of the land and displace most, if not all, of the natives and radically change the culture, religion, ethnicity and language.\n\nThe first type is when a very large group of immigrants come into a territory and take all of the land and displace most, if not all, of the natives and radically change the culture, religion, ethnicity and language.\n\n- The second type is when a small, technically superior (in military technology, organisation etc), group of immigrants takes over a country but leaves much of the underlying culture, religion, ethnicity and language intact.\n\nThe second type is when a small, technically superior (in military technology, organisation etc), group of immigrants takes over a country but leaves much of the underlying culture, religion, ethnicity and language intact.\n\n- The third type is when a group of immigrants are deliberately or accidentally let into a country, for a short period of time, before the gates are slammed shut by the indigenous population. These groups have limited impacts on the underlying culture, religion, ethnicity and language of the entire country but may dominate in those areas in the major cities where they congregate.\n\nThe third type is when a group of immigrants are deliberately or accidentally let into a country, for a short period of time, before the gates are slammed shut by the indigenous population. These groups have limited impacts on the underlying culture, religion, ethnicity and language of the entire country but may dominate in those areas in the major cities where they congregate.\n\nSo what?\n\nAll of these conjectures may be interesting. For most people there will be certain \"facts\" that they were unaware of and it is fun to see world history presented in this fashion.\n\nFantastic.\n\nBut so what?\n\nThe real question is what are the lessons that can be learned from history and how do they apply to the world today and in the future?\n\nSo here is the \"so what?\"\n\nThe population of Africa is expected to rise from 1.1 billion today to 2.4 billion in 2050 and then jump again to between 4.2- 6 billion in 2100. The population of Europe, in the meantime, is expected to shrink from 742 million today to 709 million in 2050 and to be between 639 million and 1 billion in 2100 ( source: UN World Population Highlights 2013 ).\n\nThe chart above looks at the population of Africa and Europe. The data up to 2013 is historic. You can see that in the 1950s Europe's population was 2.4 times greater than that of Africa. Sometime in the mid 1990s the population equalised and by 2013 Africa's population was 50% higher than that of Europe. Under all future scenarios Europe's population is not expected to rise that much, in most scenarios it actually drops. Under all scenarios the population of Africa is expected to increase dramatically.\n\nThe reason is due to fertility rates.\n\nEurope and North Africa are separated by the Mediterranean Sea, which is a mere 9 miles apart at its narrowest point, at the Pillars of Hercules between Morrocco and Gibraltar. Scattered along the coast are islands owned by European nations, such as Italian owned Lampedusa, and other small European outposts, remnants of European colonies, such as Spanish owned Ceuta.\n\nAs the population of North and Sub Saharan Africa increases, life there will become harder. North Africa is already unable to feed itself and relies on imports to keep its population alive. This, in itself, is not a problem. Many rich countries are not self sufficient in food. However, as the world's population increases and parts of it become more affluent, buying food from the international commodities market will become almost impossible for poorer economies. Given the current political and economic turmoil of much of North Africa and the consequent damage to their infrastucture during recent civil strife, it is hard to see North Africa becoming rich any time soon. Global warming is only going to add fuel to this bonfire of unemployment, poverty and huge population increases.\n\nParts of Europe already have very large North African immigrant populations. Over 70 percent of school age children in Holland's two biggest cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, are from North Africa or Turkey. If their extended family members in North Africa get into trouble it is only natural that they will want to aid and encourage their relatives to join them in Europe.\n\nThus it is inevitable that Europe will experience significant immigrant pressure from Africa. The historical analysis provides some scenarios of what might happen.\n\n- Will Europe be simply overwhelmed by waves of immigrants and be wiped out ethnically, culturally and linguistically? Will Christianity be replaced by Islam? This is what happened to the Neanderthals, the Romans, the Visigoths, the Taino and to American Indians.\n\nWill Europe be simply overwhelmed by waves of immigrants and be wiped out ethnically, culturally and linguistically?

This is what happened to the Neanderthals, the Romans, the Visigoths, the Taino and to American Indians.\n\n- Will a few immigrant elites topple the existing structures of government and dominate society before being absorbed into European society? This is what happened to the Ancient Greeks, the Anglo Saxons, the Chinese and Africans and Indians.\n\nWill a few immigrant elites topple the existing structures of government and dominate society before being absorbed into European society?

This is what happened in America, Post Colonial Britain and Post War Germany.\n\nWill Europe allow waves of immigration in, with the hope that immigrant populations can be kept under control. This is what happened in America, Post Colonial Britain and Post War Germany.\n\nWhich scenario is more likely?\n\nFirst we need to understand the possible scale of immigration. How many people will want to emigrate ? This is a very hard question and may be unanswerable. However, given the fact that the population of Africa is expected to increase from 1.1 billion in 2013 to 2.4 billion in 2050 and then up to 6 billion in 2100 the answer is probably \"a lot\". If 10% wanted to make the move that would be 240 million by 2050 and 600 million by 2100.\n\nThat is a lot of people and would firmly put African immigration into the first category.\n\nBye bye Europe.\n\nBut then we need to work out how many will be able to emigrate ? The Mediterranean is a formidable barrier, despite the number of successful crossings of illegal immigrants each year. It is much harder to cross than the Rio Grande, for example, that runs along much of the boundary between Mexico and the United States. It would require a significant amount of logistical coordination on the part of the immigrants for millions of them to cross the sea every year.\n\nIn turn, this would have to be matched by a significant lack of coordination on the part of the Europeans to stop them. This is not impossible to imagine. For all of the criticism about Europe being a super state and taking away sovereignty from national governments, Europe remains extremely inept at producing a coordinated foreign policy. Internal political divisions, compounded by the existing large immigrant populations, who would be driven to rescue their family members from turmoil, may make this part of foreign policy impossible to coordinate.\n\nEuropean incompetence still points to a category one immigration impact. After all, there were not that many Germans compared to the Romans.\n\nIt might be a category two immigration impact, where unwanted immigrant groups are absorbed by the larger, culturally and linguistically dominant population. This is uncertain. In a number of European cities the indigenous population is already a minority and a very small minority at school age, which suggests complete dominance by immigrant groups in those cities within a generation.\n\nWith an increased ability to stay in touch with what is going on in their ancestral lands the need to assimilate into wider society is lower than in previous eras. Technology and social networks also makes it easier to bring in brides from your country of origin, enabling them to become family members and all of their family members to become citizens under family reunification laws. And this happens when only a relatively small percentage of the population (e.g. 5% Turkish in Germany) is from immigrant stock. What if the immigrant population was 10-30% across the nation?\n\nFinally, it might be a category three immigration impact, where they are invited in or are let in by mistake (due to lack of coordination) but are insufficiently numerous to wipe out the native culture, religion, language and ethnic groups completely. Europe plays the part of Ancient Greece, China or the Anglo Saxons. Humanitarians, who are mainly on the left side of the political spectrum, will push to allow as many of the suffering masses in as they can, in a repeat of what happened in Post Colonial Britain and Post War Germany.\n\nWhich path will Europe choose?\n\nThe future has not yet happened. But policies that are put in place today will largely determine what the future will look like.\n\nFor Europeans it is too terrible to imagine the first category, where their culture, language, religion and ethnic group is effectively wiped out by huge numbers of immigrants. It is rather like an individual contemplating their own mortality; they are alive today and after a full life that has existed for as long as they can remember, it is hard to imagine being dead tomorrow. But death happens, whether you can imagine it or not.\n\nMany will argue that the historical analogs are flawed and do not relate to Europe today. The Neanderthals don't count as they existed too long ago and we don't really know what happened. The Proto Indo Europeans were military superior to the indigenous Europeans. The Taino were wiped out predominantly by disease. The North American Indians were also badly affected by disease and still exist, albeit in isolated Reservations. The Romans did lose their lands and culture but Christianity dominated long after they lost territorial superiority.\n\nBut burying your head in the sand is not really a policy. What could Europe do to ensure that few, if any, of these scenarios comes to pass?\n\n- As a minimum it needs to ensure that North Africa is stable and well governed.\n\nAs a minimum it needs to ensure that North Africa is stable and well governed.\n\n- North Africa needs to be rich enough to import its own food and needs to provide worthwhile jobs for its armies of young men.\n\nNorth Africa needs to be rich enough to import its own food and needs to provide worthwhile jobs for its armies of young men.\n\n- Education and support for women will help reduce fertility rates and will reduce the cultural gap between Europe and North Africa.\n\nEducation and support for women will help reduce fertility rates and will reduce the cultural gap between Europe and North Africa.\n\n- A strong North Africa can help provide a buffer zone from Sub Saharan Africa, which it is separated by a desert that is almost as formidable a barrier as the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nA strong North Africa can help provide a buffer zone from Sub Saharan Africa, which it is separated by a desert that is almost as formidable a barrier as the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nUltimately, people don't really want to emigrate if they don't have to. Make North Africa appealing for North Africans. This requires cultural, economic and political tools and not military might. Remember, during the Roman Empire North Africa was more important to the financial well being of the empire than Britain, Gaul and Hispania.\n\nHumans coming out of Africa wiped out the indigenous European population 20,000 years ago. Europe needs to take a proactive approach to Africa while it still can.\n\nEmigration: Colonies Of The Mind And Space",

News, which had been hereto rather fact based, with the occasional opinion piece, was repackaged as entertainment with highly opinionated news programme producers and presenters using cable news to push a particular political angle. All of this is not new, and has been written about before.\n\nWhat is more interesting is the effect of social media which is taking this move towards personalised targeting of news to an extreme level. The process started years ago with services such as Google Alerts. These alerts once requested would send you a list of news stories every day or hour (depending on your needs) about a particular subject that interested you. But this method was, in effect, a crude way of searching for specific terms on a specific schedule. Many people who never got around to updating their preferences would have articles hitting their email inboxes in which they no longer interested.\n\nSocial media sites such as Stumble Upon, Reddit, Flipboard and Facebook are making it even easier for you to find stories that \"people like you\" want to read. The more you read of a certain type of article the more frequently that kind of article will appear in your Stumble Upon or Flipboard selection. This is more intuitive than the Google Alerts approach as it does not require you to enter a specific search term. Your prior choices dictate which articles you will receive, articles that will interest you personally more than anything else. If you have a particular interest in 18th century crochet patterns, for example, intuitive targeting is a perfect way to receive subject matter ad infinitum. Equally, if you are politically inclined to think that gay marriage is good, (or bad) or that higher taxes for the rich is good (or bad), you will be fed articles that support that particular view.\n\nSo what impact does this targeted media have on democracy? There are clearly benefits to this great fragmentation. One result is that your particular interest can be sated by receipt of programmes and articles that addresses issues that really concern or interest you. You suddenly realise that you are not alone and that your opinions are echoed by numbers of like-minded people. The realisation gives one confidence to push for your particular agenda into a wider society.\n\nHowever, your particular views may be amplified in an echo chamber of like-minded thoughts. Access only to self-selective argument can reduce the chance that you will hear about opposing opinions for a particular issue. Chances are that your knowledge of an issue will have been pre-filtered before you receive the information. When the opinions of controversial views intrude you may consider their expressed opinions as odd, crazy views. Since these opinions appear to be so different to the ones that you hold, the holders of these views must be either intellectually retarded, at best, or simply evil, at worst.\n\nIn the US, this wild variance of fervently held opinions has reached such levels that the proper functioning of civil society is impeded. The only time that one group is likely to hear the differing opinions of other groups is during elections for political office. In this period there is a lot of shouting, and very little listening.\n\nArguably, there are now so many interest groups that social cohesion has been fragmented. The extreme diversity of opinion makes it hard to achieve any form of broad consensus on matters that affect everyone. Gaining enough broad political support for a minority interest agenda becomes increasingly unlikely as a result.\n\nSo who does benefit from this fragmentation?\n\nThe Romans had a maxim of divide et impera - divide and rule. They applied it to territories that they had conquered by splitting the lands into smaller parts with parochial leaders who would squabble amongst themselves.\n\nIn our increasingly divided society someone is benefiting from this chaos.\n\nWho?\n\nPrisons: We Never Used To Have Them.

Judges issued injunctions. Journalists wrote stories about the human cost of layoffs. Politicians who had spent decades expanding government programmes accused DOGE of recklessness. The bureaucracy, in short, defended itself -- with every tool at its disposal.\n\nThis is not new. It is the oldest story in the history of governance. And understanding it requires going back much further than 2025.\n\nPart 1: Rome -- From Lean Republic to Administrative Empire\n\nThe Roman Republic was, by ancient standards, remarkably lean. The Senate and the magistrates governed an expanding territory with a minimal permanent bureaucracy. Provincial governors were appointed for fixed terms. Tax collection was outsourced to private contractors (publicani). The army was a citizen militia, called up for specific campaigns and disbanded afterwards. The entire system was designed to prevent any individual or institution from accumulating permanent power.\n\nThis changed under the Empire. Augustus, the first emperor, created a professional civil service to administer the vast territories that the Republic's ad hoc system could no longer manage. This was a rational response to a real problem: you cannot govern an empire stretching from Britain to Mesopotamia with part-time magistrates and private tax farmers. You need permanent officials, standardised procedures, and institutional continuity.\n\nBut the bureaucracy grew. And grew. By the time of Diocletian (284-305 AD), the Roman administrative apparatus had become enormous. Diocletian divided the empire into over 100 provinces (up from about 50 under Augustus), each with its own governor, staff, and administrative hierarchy. He created a vast network of state factories (fabricae) to supply the army, a system of price controls (the Edict on Maximum Prices), and a tax system so complex that it required an army of assessors, collectors, and auditors to operate.\n\nThe historian A.H.M. Jones estimated that the late Roman bureaucracy employed tens of thousands of officials, supported by an even larger number of clerks, scribes, and enforcers. The cost of maintaining this apparatus was staggering. Lactantius, writing in the early fourth century, complained that \"the number of recipients began to exceed the number of contributors\" -- that there were more people living off the state than paying into it.\n\nThe bureaucracy did not just consume resources. It actively resisted reform. Officials who owed their positions, their income, and their social status to the existing system had every incentive to preserve it and no incentive to streamline it. When emperors attempted to reduce the administrative burden, they found that the bureaucracy simply absorbed the reforms and continued expanding. New positions were created to oversee the elimination of old positions. Commissions to reduce complexity produced additional layers of complexity.\n\nThe Roman bureaucracy did not cause the fall of the Western Empire. But it contributed to the sclerosis that made the empire unable to respond effectively to the crises of the fifth century. When the Visigoths, Vandals, and other Germanic peoples pressed against the frontiers, the empire's response was slow, uncoordinated, and often counterproductive -- not because it lacked resources, but because the administrative machinery that was supposed to deploy those resources had become an end in itself.\n\nPart 2: The Ottomans and the Janissary Problem\n\nThe Ottoman Empire offers an even more dramatic illustration of the same pattern.\n\nIn the fourteenth century, the Ottomans created the devshirme system -- a practice of taking Christian boys from the Balkans, converting them to Islam, and training them as elite soldiers (Janissaries) and administrators. The system was designed to create a loyal, meritocratic governing class with no ties to the existing Ottoman aristocracy. The boys owed everything to the Sultan and nothing to any family, tribe, or faction. It was, in its way, a brilliant solution to the problem of bureaucratic capture.\n\nFor two centuries, it worked extraordinarily well. The Janissaries were the most formidable military force in Europe and the Near East. Ottoman administrators were competent, loyal, and efficient. The empire expanded from a small Anatolian principality to a superpower controlling southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.\n\nBut the Janissaries, like all bureaucratic classes, eventually began to serve their own interests. By the seventeenth century, they had secured the right to marry, to pass their positions to their sons, and to engage in private commerce. They had become, in effect, a hereditary caste -- exactly what the devshirme system had been designed to prevent. They used their military power to veto reforms, depose sultans who threatened their privileges, and block the adoption of new military technologies (particularly firearms and European-style drill) that would have reduced their importance.\n\nBy the eighteenth century, the Janissaries were a parasitic institution. They consumed a large share of the state's revenue, provided increasingly poor military performance, and violently resisted every attempt at modernisation. Sultan Selim III attempted to create a new, modern army in the 1790s. The Janissaries murdered him. His successor, Mahmud II, spent sixteen years carefully preparing before he finally disbanded the Janissaries by force in 1826, in what became known as the \"Auspicious Incident.\" Thousands of Janissaries were killed. Their barracks were destroyed. Their very name was erased from official records.\n\nThe parallel with modern bureaucracies is uncomfortable but instructive. The Janissaries were created to serve the state. They ended up holding the state hostage. The only way to remove them was through an act of deliberate, planned, and violent destruction by the sovereign power. No reform from within was possible, because the Janissaries controlled the mechanisms of reform.\n\nPart 3: China's Examination System -- Meritocracy Ossified\n\nThe Chinese imperial examination system, established in its mature form during the Sui Dynasty (605 AD) and lasting until 1905, was perhaps the most sophisticated meritocratic bureaucracy in human history. Any man, regardless of birth, could in theory rise to the highest offices of state by passing a series of increasingly difficult examinations in Confucian classics, poetry, and administrative theory.\n\nFor centuries, this system produced a governing class of remarkable competence. Chinese administration was, by the standards of its time, extraordinarily efficient. The empire maintained roads, canals, granaries, and a postal system across a territory larger than Europe. It conducted regular censuses, collected taxes with reasonable efficiency, and provided a degree of public order that European visitors found astonishing.\n\nBut the examination system became ossified. The curriculum was fixed on the Confucian classics and did not evolve to incorporate new knowledge -- science, technology, economics, or military strategy. The system selected for men who could write elegant eight-legged essays on ancient texts, not for men who could build railways, design weapons, or negotiate with foreign powers. By the nineteenth century, China's bureaucratic class was superbly educated in a body of knowledge that was largely irrelevant to the challenges the empire faced.\n\nWhen Western powers arrived with steamships, modern artillery, and industrial economies, China's bureaucracy was unable to respond effectively. The examination system had created a class of administrators who were brilliant within their domain but incapable of thinking outside it. Reformers who proposed adopting Western technology and methods were blocked by officials whose entire careers, identities, and social status depended on the existing system. The result was China's \"century of humiliation\" -- a period of military defeats, unequal treaties, and territorial losses that only ended with the Communist revolution in 1949.\n\nPart 4: The Modern Western Bureaucracy\n\nThe growth of Western bureaucracies since 1945 follows the same pattern, albeit in a less dramatic form.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Western governments expanded rapidly to provide the welfare state, regulate the economy, and manage the Cold War. This expansion was, like Diocletian's reforms and the Ottoman devshirme, a rational response to real problems. Citizens needed healthcare, pensions, education, and social insurance. Economies needed regulation to prevent the kind of catastrophic failures that had produced the Great Depression. National defence required permanent military establishments and intelligence agencies.\n\nBut C. Northcote Parkinson, writing in 1955, identified the dynamic that would define the next seventy years: \"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\" Parkinson demonstrated, with characteristically dry British humour, that the number of officials in the British Colonial Office continued to grow even as the number of colonies shrank. The Admiralty employed more civil servants as the Royal Navy got smaller. Bureaucracies, Parkinson observed, expand not because there is more work to do, but because officials create work for each other.\n\nThe numbers bear this out. In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations has grown from approximately 10,000 pages in 1950 to over 180,000 pages today. The European Union produces an estimated 2,500 new regulations per year. The UK's tax code is now longer than the complete works of Shakespeare -- several times over. Each regulation requires officials to draft it, implement it, enforce it, and adjudicate disputes about it. Each official requires managers, support staff, office space, and pension contributions. The system feeds itself.\n\nSupra-national bureaucracies have compounded the problem. The European Union employs approximately 60,000 officials in its institutions -- a number that does not include the hundreds of thousands of national officials required to implement EU directives. The United Nations system employs over 75,000 people. The World Health Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund, and dozens of other international bodies each maintain their own permanent bureaucracies, with their own budgets, their own career structures, and their own institutional imperatives.\n\nThese organisations were created to solve specific problems. Many of those problems have been solved, or have changed beyond recognition, or have proved insoluble. But the organisations persist, because the people who work in them have mortgages, careers, pensions, and identities that depend on the organisation's continued existence. As Thomas Sowell has observed, it is almost impossible to name a government programme that has been terminated because it achieved its objectives. Success and failure produce the same result: the programme continues.\n\nPart 5: DOGE and the AI Revolution\n\nThis is the context in which DOGE must be understood. Elon Musk's initiative is not the first attempt to cut government waste. The United States has a long history of such efforts: the Hoover Commissions (1947 and 1953), the Grace Commission (1982), Al Gore's \"Reinventing Government\" initiative (1993), and numerous others. All produced reports. All identified billions in potential savings. All were largely absorbed by the bureaucracy they were designed to reform.\n\nWhat makes DOGE potentially different is technology. Artificial intelligence can do much of what bureaucrats do -- process applications, check compliance, review contracts, detect fraud, answer queries -- faster, cheaper, and more accurately. AI does not need a pension. It does not form a union. It does not create work for itself. It does not resist its own obsolescence.\n\nThe implications are profound. If AI can replace a significant portion of government administrative functions, then the economic and political case for maintaining large permanent bureaucracies collapses. Governments could become dramatically leaner -- not by cutting services, but by delivering the same services with a fraction of the human staff. Tax collection, benefits administration, regulatory compliance, procurement, and dozens of other functions could be largely automated.\n\nThis is not speculation. Estonia has already demonstrated what a digitally native government looks like. Estonian citizens can file taxes in minutes, vote online, start a business in hours, and access virtually all government services through a single digital identity. Estonia achieves this with a fraction of the per-capita government employment of larger European nations.\n\nPart 6: What Comes Next\n\nHistory suggests two possible futures.\n\nIn the first, AI enables a genuine reduction in the size and cost of government. Nations that successfully slim their states gain a competitive advantage: lower taxes, faster decision-making, less regulatory burden on businesses and individuals, and more resources available for productive investment. The 2030s see a divergence between lean, AI-enabled states and bloated, bureaucracy-captured states. The lean states attract talent, investment, and innovation. The bloated states stagnate.\n\nIn the second, the bureaucracy absorbs AI just as it has absorbed every previous reform. AI systems are deployed not to replace officials but to assist them -- creating new roles for \"AI oversight officers,\" \"algorithmic accountability managers,\" and \"digital ethics compliance coordinators.\" The technology that should have reduced the bureaucracy instead adds another layer to it. Parkinson's Law prevails, as it always has.\n\nThe supra-national dimension adds further complexity. The European Union's approach to AI regulation -- the AI Act, the Digital Services Act, and the growing body of algorithmic governance rules -- risks creating an entirely new bureaucratic apparatus dedicated to regulating the technology that was supposed to reduce bureaucracy. If the EU requires thousands of officials to oversee AI systems that were designed to replace thousands of officials, the net effect is zero -- or worse.\n\nThe historical pattern is clear. Bureaucracies that cannot be reformed from within must eventually be dismantled from without. The Roman bureaucracy was swept away by the Germanic kingdoms. The Janissaries were destroyed by the Sultan's cannon. China's examination system was abolished by revolution. In each case, the institution had to be broken because it could not be bent.\n\nThe question for the 2030s is whether democratic societies can achieve what Mahmud II achieved in 1826 -- the deliberate, planned dismantling of a parasitic institutional class -- without the violence. AI provides, for the first time in history, a tool that could make this possible. Whether it will be used for that purpose, or whether it will be captured by the very institutions it threatens, is the defining governance question of our time.\n\nJuvenal's question remains unanswered. But for the first time, we may have a guard that does not need guarding.\n\nIs Democracy The Opium Of The Masses?",

Curiously for the time, Aton was a god that had no physical form at all. He was just to be imagined and no depictions of Aton were allowed - except for a \"sun disk\", which is what Aton means.\n\nAkhen aton - who was married to the beautiful Nefertiti - forcibly converted the entire country of Egypt into becoming worshipers of Aton, at the expense of all of the other traditional gods. As Pharaoh, and in charge of all of the wealth of the state, Akhen aton had the power and authority to close rival shrines and temples have the names of other gods removed from monuments. He abandoned the ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes and built a new capital on the banks of the Nile. What was unique about Akhen aton was that he did not just believe that there was one chief god but he also believed that there was only one god and that all other gods were false. Aton was thus the world's first monotheistic god, long before the Jews dedicated themselves to their one god, Yahweh.\n\nIt was no easy task to permanently rid the country of all of the other gods. After Akhenaton died in 1336 BCE the capital moved back to Thebes. The god Aton was rejected by Egypt and the ruler Akhen aton's name was in turn chiseled from stone inscriptions on monuments that he had erected. Akhenaton's name was also removed from most of the official records of Egyptian Pharaohs; it is amazing that we know anything about him at all. Freed from his father-in-law's influence, Tutankh aton changed his name to the more familiar Tutankh amon.\n\nStrict monotheism required the backing of the state to thrive. Without that support it died. The natural religious order for ancient Egypt was polytheism.\n\nThe fundamental difference between monotheism and polytheism is that polytheists can happily co-exist with other religious groups. In fact they thrive on picking and choosing the best elements of other gods, no matter where they come from. The Romans and Greeks were masters at this and frequently used double barreled names to describe their gods, connecting a more familiar god with a more foreign god. This preference encourages multiculturalism and the exchange of goods and ideas.\n\nMonotheism, however, requires the denial of the existence of other gods. If your god is the one and only true god, it follows that all other gods must be false. For others to believe in those false gods is an affront to your one and only god. This affront must be excised, and to do this effectively your faith must dominate completely.\n\nOnce monotheism, in the form of Judaism, followed by Christianity got underway, however, there came to be a realisation that it was not enough to have one true god. It was necessary to have one way of worshipping and interpreting that one true god. All other ways threatened your existence. These schisms explain the external conflicts between the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the internal conflicts between Christian sects and Shia and Sunni Islam. The suppression of science in the medieval world resulted as new ideas came into conflict with long held religious belief. New scientific ideas, like Galileo's helio-centric solar system, were a threat to monotheistic dominance.\n\nThe preeminence followed by the decline of Monotheism also partially explains the simultaneous rise in multiculturalism in Europe and the fall in the number of regular Christian churchgoers in the modern era. As fewer Europeans are Christian believers in general, and specific Christian sect members in particular, there is less of a need for Europeans to demand that all other people follow their faith and sect. Not only is it widely accepted that people might be agnostic or atheist (which was originally a derogatory term for Christians who denied the existence of the traditional pantheon of Roman gods) but also that the existence of other gods can be tolerated as well.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that modern Europe is so effective from a multicultural perspective. Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Romania, Sweden etc all have different languages, cultures and religions - albeit variations on Christianity. Within their borders Europeans and non-European peoples are accepted. Freedom of religion is enshrined in European law. A requirement for all people living in Europe to be faithful to one Christian God of one Christian sect would make pan-European co-operation significantly harder.\n\nThis tolerance is in sharp contrast to many Muslim countries. States which forbid open worship of religions other than Islam, countries where Muslims kill fellow Muslims due to doctrinal differences. Conversion away from Islam (apostasy) is a capital offence, while becoming a Muslim is automatic at birth. Multi-culturalism is effectively impossible in those countries.\n\nAs more non-Europeans of Islamic heritage live in the European Union it could have the effect of making Islam more tolerant in Islamic countries. Migrants will have seen that it is possible to worship their own god alongside non-believers and to live in harmony.\n\nEqually, it could be seen as a cautionary tale. Once people are allowed to stop believing in a particular religion or to abandon their faith for another faith, or even to drop religion entirely, they may. To prevent this abandonment a logical reaction is for religious zealots to fight harder to make a particular religion more powerful and more inclined to subjugate and brainwash its worshippers.\n\nMonotheism is hard to maintain without the firm backing of the state.\n\nAre Europeans Fundamentally Racist?",

Scandal, a TV series set amongst the politics and backstabbing of the Washington DC elite, has the president's male chief of staff get married to his long-term male lover.

Both lead characters are, in fact, bisexual.\n\nTV has always both reflected society and has shown it how it ought to be. The original Star Trek series was controversial in its portrayal of blacks and women in senior officer positions.

Female Presidents on screen are yet to be followed by real world female counterparts. Hillary Clinton is likely to become the first female US President.\n\nAttitudes to homosexuality are changing. Attitudes measured by different ages groups would show greater levels of acceptance towards homosexuality at the younger end, and greater levels of intolerance at the older end of the scale. People in their 80s are generally horrified, people in their 60s are split between those who are uncomfortable and those who want to be seen as \"progressive\", people in their 40s are generally okay with it, but would rather their children did not turn out gay, and people in their 20s are extremely tolerant and not bothered at all.\n\nIf you extrapolate this trend twenty years into the future and move all of the age cohorts up 20 years, allowing for a new group of young adults in their 20s, you should expect the bulk of society to be either extremely tolerant or generally tolerant of homosexuality by 2033, if not earlier.\n\nBeing gay is no longer such a big deal. This is a relief for so many who have had to hide their feelings from not only their friends and family but also from themselves. Clearly there are many parts of society that are horrified by the ease at which people can switch their sexual orientation. They claim that this is a slippery slope that will lead to widespread social acceptance of bestiality, pedophilia, incest, polygamy and any other sexual depravity that they can imagine.\n\nSex, gender and race\n\nSexual orientation and preference, however, has always been heavily linked to what was socially acceptable at the time.\n\nGreek men, during the classical period, started off with homosexuality and then, as they got older, become bisexual or heterosexual. This was normal behaviour and was not just tolerated but was encouraged, institutionalised and celebrated in literature and art. Alexander the Great was an incredible soldier and general. A strong, masculine, man in all ways. He also had a homosexual lover, his boyhood friend Hephaestion, who led Alexander's cavalry. Achilles was also a tremendous warrior and leader of men. His homosexual lover was Patroclus and his death was the trigger that sent Achilles back into battle against the Trojans. There was nothing effeminate about any of those men.\n\nSexual relations between African Americans and Anglo-Americans was heavily frowned upon until not that long ago. It was illegal for blacks and whites to marry each other in many parts of the United States until 1967. Today interracial marriages and mixed race children are becoming very frequent. People are no longer confining themselves to sexual partners who share the same skin colour or general facial characteristics.\n\nGays today, however, are still discriminated against. In most countries gays are not allowed to marry, or to benefit from their partner's pension rights, nor to have automatic legal authority in the event of a medical emergency, and so forth. Church weddings are generally a no no. However, the law is changing. A few states in the US have allowed gay marriages to be recognised legally. Other European countries have also removed anti gay laws over the past 10 years.\n\nIn the past people restricted their sexual partners for other reasons, ranging from caste (which still is a problem in India today), socio-economic levels and religion. While it is clear that people still generally marry and have sexual relations with people of the opposite sex those that are of similar backgrounds, choosing a partner outside of these boundaries is no longer socially taboo.\n\nFrom history we can thus conclude that what was considered normal during one time period can later be deemed disgusting and what was deemed disgusting can later be deemed normal.\n\nHumans are extremely adaptable.\n\nSex, work, home and kids\n\nPart of the reason for an increasing acceptance of homosexuality is thanks to huge strides towards gender equality. The difference between men and women has started to blur.\n\nMen and women in their 60s today grew up in a world where women were beginning to gain access to roles in society to which they had previously been denied on the basis of their gender. As a result there are now a number of women in senior positions in society, ranging from government posts to directorships in corporations. But these women are generally trendsetters. Many had to be better than men in order to break through the glass ceiling and to get into these senior positions.\n\nBy contrast, women in their 40s today grew up in a world where there were many female role models who were already successful. They knew that the glass ceiling was breakable and that they could go through it, if they chose to do so. As the workplace has evolved there are more roles today that seem to be better suited for women than \"traditional\" men, who were employed in dirty and dangerous factory and mining jobs. Jobs that have now disappeared to other parts of the world and been lost to automation.\n\nFor women in their 20s there is almost nothing that they cannot do that a man can do. Health and safety legislation means that there is no premium on the only advantage that most men have over most women: physical strength. In addition, greater numbers of working women has spurred a number of innovations that make it easier for women to remain in the workplace and for their households to continue to run in their absence.\n\nMany dual income professional couples have a lot of home help, ranging from nannies to cooks and cleaners. As the West's economy gets further hollowed out you should expect to see increased levels of personal service for those who have well paid internationally focused jobs by those who do not. This should help to reduce some of the problems associated with working parents today: if you have school aged children juggling a job with kids can be a logistical nightmare. While you can get to work by 9am, after the school drop off, you may have to leave work to pick them up again at 2:30pm. That does not leave much time for work and do all of the regular chores needed to keep a household going.\n\nWomen can also embark on their careers without worrying about their biological clocks. There is not only a thriving business in fertilised egg storage and IVF treatment but also in surrogate wombs, where wealthier women hire surrogates mothers, frequently in countries such as India, to carry their fertilised eggs to term, nine months later. Cheap DNA sequencing technologies - which once cost millions of dollars - now allow prospective parents to test for diseases and make preferences in selecting which fertilised eggs they want to implant. Instead of randomly implanting two or three it would make sense to select those that are least likely to have any genetic problems. All of these technologies extend a woman's ability to have children well into their forties and fifties.\n\nHistorically men could work long hours without worrying about childcare. They knew that they would have a comfortable home to go back to, that their child would be literally grown in someone else's womb and would be raised by someone who loves them. This allowed them to continue their careers without stopping. These changes in the workplace, at home and in sexual reproduction have a profound impact on how easy it is for women to become fully \"equal\" to men.\n\nYou should expect all of these innovations to continue and to be more widely adopted throughout western society over the next twenty years.\n\nFriends\n\nYoung adults are more likely to have good friends of both sexes than they were in previous generations. If you are in your 60s or 80s it is likely that if you had a hen party or stag party it would have been only with your same sex friends. If you are in your 40s there were probably a few friends that you had of the opposite sex that you wanted to invite but it felt odd to do so. If you are in your 20s the concept of only having a stag party with your male friends or hen night with your female friends will feel even more peculiar. While tradition says that these events should be held with those of the same gender the reality is that young people have an increasing number of good friends from both genders.\n\nIn part this is because boys and girls have the same career and social expectations for the future. They also like to do many of the same things. Computer gaming, for example, has become huge. If you are in your 40s, it was the preserve of slightly geeky nerds. For those over 40 they did not really exist as a child. Yet if you are in your 20s gaming is a major part of socialising where there is no physical difference between male and female abilities. This is different from playing a physical sport, which is still separated by gender to differentiate for male strength superiority.\n\nCamera equipped phones, tablets and computers have also increased the amount of casual nudism and sex. Every teenager is a click away from free, high definition porn, wherever they are. Sexting, a modern phenomena where people can send short nude pictures or videos of themselves, is also popular. Exposure to these images seems to be affecting the ways that young people think of sex. Sex has become more about casual recreation than procreation; something fun to do, rather than as the culmination of an emotional bond.\n\nYoung adults also live together in mixed houses for prolonged periods of time, in a way that you would be familiar with if you are in your 40s, (Remember \"Friends\" the massively popular TV show?) but quite unfamiliar if you are in your 60s or 80s. Many young people are locked out of the housing market due to high prices and so will share housing with friends until their late 20s or early 30s.\n\nHouse sharing gives rise to two peculiar extremes. First, many housemates become such good friends with members of the opposite sex that it makes the thought of having sex with any of them odd - almost incestuous. Second, they are so used to having a fulfilling emotional life with these friends that finding someone outside their circle to have a relationship with ironically becomes harder. Friends may hook up, occasionally, to fulfill casual sexual needs (despite the incestuous \"yuk\" factor), but remain firmly \"not an item\" for the rest of the time.\n\nThe lack of good jobs and the consequent inability to afford your own home will push back the average age that women have their first child.\n\nAndrogyny: the lack of gender distinction\n\nHistorically there was a significant gap between what was expected of women and men. Laws have traditionally discriminated against women: restricting them on ownership, inheritance, dress code and even limited free speech. When mass education started it was just boys who had access to it first. Not women. In many non-western societies these restrictions and discrimination still exists.\n\nIn rural communities the actual level of discrimination was generally less than that which was officially sanctioned. Not for ideological reasons but for practical ones. White skinned, delicate women that needed \"protection\" may have been the ideal for a rich landlord but a tenant farmer needed a wife who was robust and hard working. A wife who could have several children without complaint (or dying) and could then go out and work under the hot sun in the fields the next day. Many women did not survive childbirth, resulting in many re-marriages between older men and younger women. As the men got older and more frail it is hard to imagine the younger woman did not dominating the relationship.\n\nOnce upon a time boys were clearly supposed to go out with girls and girls were supposed to go out with boys. Peer pressure pushed the opposite sexes into each other's arms. Today, however, the distinction between boys and girls has gotten much narrower. Whereas you would have had gangs of boys and gaggles of girls doing things separately now you have rabbles of boys and girls doing things together. Young women go out on \"the piss\" and beat up unsuspecting bystanders, just like young men. An example of when equality is sometimes not that desirable.\n\nThis intermingling of people happened with race previously - black skinned and white skinned people were once artificially separated. Now they mingle together. They are no longer separated on the basis of skin colour and facial morphology. If boys and girls are now essentially the same, in interests, aspirations, hobbies, clothing, hairstyles, and friendship the distinction between boys and girls starts to fall away. They become androgynous.\n\nIf sex is no longer necessary for procreation - thanks to advances in IVF and surrogacy - then the difference in sexual organs between men and women is no longer that important. Two men can have a baby - as in the TV show Scandal. Two women can have a baby - as in the TV show Grey's Anatomy. The only real sexual difference that remains is, crudely speaking, that women have two holes and men have one hole and a protrusion. Is that difference any greater than skin colour, hair colour, eye colour, nose and eye shape? Sexual orientation becomes a matter of choice, which may change in the same way that one person might like to play football but then may want to switch to playing tennis.\n\nIf the distinction between gender falls away and young people become androgynous then all sex between them is homo (\"same\") sexual. Since homosexuality has fallen away as a taboo bisexuality, the act of hopping into bed with the same or different gender and then back again, is also no longer taboo.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nDoes this mean that everyone is going to become bisexual? Clearly not. Human reproduction is based on millions of years of evolution that has hard-wired humans to reproduce with the opposite sex. The urge for reproduction will still result in more relationships being with the opposite sex. Our brains want sex and it will remain significantly cheaper and easier as a reproductive option than IVF and surrogacy.\n\nRicher people, however, could start to opt for more extra uterine fertilisation. This will enable them to ensure healthier, \"perfect\", children and for two high-income parents surrogacy could potentially be more desirable and certainly affordable. In North America more and more women are opting for Caesarian section delivery of their babies. It is more convenient - it can be scheduled, is less painful in the short term, and doctors believe it to be safer for the medical profession, reducing the likelihood of them being sued for malpractice over bad vaginal deliveries. Over time this could result in extra uterine fertilisation becoming something that less well off people aspire to and save up for.\n\nIf this does become more \"normal\", and that is a big if, the normal drive for sexual reproduction could become repressed. In Japan and Korea this already seems to be an issue where the reproductive rate for women has plummeted. They just don't want kids anymore.\n\nIf a growing disinclination for children persists you should see a significant drop in the number of children born into that society and an increase in homosexual or bisexual relationships. For some this is to be celebrated - greater equality for all. Others will find this frightening.\n\nWill this trend last?\n\n\"Traditional\" families, however, are likely to have the last laugh. The trend towards bisexuality and homosexuality is likely to swing back the other way. The simple reason is that the number of children born to rich dual income couples, bisexual couples and homosexual couples is likely to be smaller than those bred into heterosexuals in more \"traditional\" families.\n\nRelatively speaking traditional heterosexual couples - who include large numbers of immigrants from developing countries - will breed like rabbits, resulting in a society that is more likely to be in their image than not. For conservative Muslims and Christians this may be a source of comfort in a Western world that they will find increasingly abhorrent.\n\nThe Unintended Consequences of War: How the Loss of Young Men Transformed Women's Roles in Society and ushered in the Welfare State",

It was the economic ability to live separately that then enabled the significant social change of splitting up the extended family. History Future Now believes that the nuclear family is a historical aberration and ultimately doomed to fail.\n\nExtended family is historically and geographically the norm\n\nIn many parts of the world today the extended family remains the norm. Most families in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Southern Europe live in households that are multi generational in their make up, with grandparents, parents and children all living under the same roof. In some countries, such as Iraq, the extended family concept is so broad that the marriage of first cousins is encouraged, keeping the wealth and the family even closer together.\n\nIn the West, if you go as far back as the late Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire the paterfamilias concept extended not just to all of the immediate family members living in a household, but also to a vast retinue of slaves, freedmen and clients.\n\nThe break up of the extended family in the West was triggered by the the Industrial Revolution, which was a major driver of internal and external migrations. Young men and women would leave their family households and go into temporary lodgings near to their place of work. Eventually they would marry and set up a home away from their extended families.\n\nWe are seeing the same pattern occurring in countries like China today, where millions of young Chinese from the central and western parts of China have left their hometowns and villages to seek jobs in factories along the coast. Many households are neither extended families nor nuclear families, but rather single dwellings or group dormitories, with a completely different set of social rules and norms.\n\nThe impact of the Great Recession on families\n\nInterestingly, the decline of jobs in the West, due to the Great Recession and a general trend towards outsourcing jobs to lower cost countries, robotics, automation and software, has resulted in an increase in the number of people living in extended families. The number of multi-generational households in the US shot up from 2007 to 2009, according to a October 2011 report by the Pew Research Centre. It observes that:\n\nWithout public debate or fanfare, large numbers of Americans enacted their own anti-poverty program in the depths of the Great Recession: They moved in with relatives. This helped fuel the largest increase in the number of Americans living in multi-generational households in modern history. From 2007 to 2009, the total spiked from 46.5 million to 51.4 million.\n\nLiving in a multi-generational household appears to be a financial lifeline for many. Although their adjusted incomes overall are lower, the poverty rate among people in multi-generational households is substantially smaller than for those in other households--11.5% vs. 14.6% in 2009, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.\n\nMoreover, the potential benefits of living in multi-generational households are greatest for the groups that have been most affected by the Great Recession. Among the unemployed, the poverty rate in 2009 was 17.5% for those living in multi-generational households, compared with 30.3% for those living in other households.\n\nThe statistics from 2009 to 2012 are not yet available, but it is likely that the percentage has increased significantly since 2009.\n\nThe nuclear family is unsustainable economically\n\nMuch of the analysis and press about the re-emergence of the extended family in the West focuses on the fact that it is expensive to live apart and how living together is cheaper for everybody. The implication is that once the economy gets moving again, people will go back to their old ways and extended family units will split apart.\n\nHistory Future Now is not so sure.\n\nThe decline of the extended family was mirrored by the simultaneous increase in the size of government in order to provide the services that were once handled by the extended family. Essentially big government has replaced the role of the extended family in many societies today. Since big government is no longer affordable, the nuclear family will no longer be affordable either. Here are four examples where a move to living in extended families would help reduce costs and reduce the size of government.\n\nChildcare. The government currently provides childcare for young families. This is in the form of funding for nursery placements for pre school age children. This is expensive, but arguably helpful for the economy as it frees more parents to enter the work force, or to remain in the workforce. In an extended family, childcare is provided by a combination of grandparents and parents. This is good for young people as they can develop relationships with adults other than their parents and good for old people as spending time with young people keeps them active.\n\nRetirement homes. The government currently pays for retirement homes - old people's homes - for people who are retired and are unable to live on their own. This is expensive, but arguably helpful for the economy as it frees up adult children from having to look after their parents, enabling them to remain in the workforce. In an extended family old people can live at home for a much longer period until they get sick or are unable to do anything for themselves. This saves money for the government and is better for the older people.\n\nPensions. The government currently provides pensions for its retired citizens. This is expensive and takes money from the existing workforce in the form of taxes and hands it to retired people in the form of benefits. Given the shrinking number of people in the workforce due to demographics and fewer jobs, this burden is increasingly large for the existing workforce. If people lived in extended families the cost of housing and living would be lower. This would mean that government pensions could be smaller and still enable retired people to live comfortable lives.\n\nUnemployment and housing benefits. The government currently provides benefits for people who are unemployed and housing for those who are in need of housing. This is expensive. If people lived in extended families housing benefits would not be necessary and the reduced cost of living due to being in shared family accommodation would mean that unemployment benefits could be lower and still enable unemployed people to live without falling below the poverty line.\n\nA fall in GDP would be a good thing\n\nThe basic measurement of a country's economic well being is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We talk about GDP per capita (or its cousin Gross National Product -GNP) and growth in GDP and think that the higher both numbers are the better off we will be. The problem with GDP is that all it measures is money changing hands in an economy. If you pay for childcare that has an impact on GDP. If your parents look after your children while you are at work there is no impact on GDP. If you divorce, sell your house, and buy two new houses and furnishings GDP goes up, but it is hard to argue that this has been a good thing for society.\n\nPeople living in nuclear families and as singletons are great for GDP as they need lots of services to be provided by other people as it is impossible to live completely on your own. The number of purchased services required is huge and range from builders, plumbers, painters, dog walkers and fast food all the way to therapists and cleaners. Other services are provided by the government, as noted above. If more people lived in extended families you should expect a significant drop in the GDP of a country. If you are a politician who has pledged to boost GDP and employment, promoting extended families will not get you there.\n\nGovernments in the West are heavily indebted and as discussed in a previous article there is no real way out, with the exception of debt jubilees (or defaults) and hyperinflation. But even if the debt disappeared, the underlying problem remains - living outside extended families is enormously expensive and there are not enough good jobs to pay for the way of life that we have become used to.\n\nThe great irony that many people are realising, however, is that they are working in order to pay for the services that are provided by non family members. If the extended family provided a lot of those services then they would not need to work as long hours or earn such a high income to pay for them.\n\nThere is hope\n\nWhile some people cant stand their in laws, parents, or kids, for the vast bulk of society the extended family is a wonderful thing. However, it will take time to readjust to living together. There will be friction as adult children and their parents work out how to live together with mutual respect.\n\nIt is just worth remembering that for the past 70,000 years of human history we have lived very successfully in extended families and it is only in the last 100 years that we have done anything different. A brave politician (I know a number of you read this) would go against the prevailing trends and would advocate extended family friendly policies.\n\nThere is reason to think that we can adjust. There is hope.\n\nLets Talk About Sex: Does The Separation Of Pleasure And Procreation Mean The End Of People?",
