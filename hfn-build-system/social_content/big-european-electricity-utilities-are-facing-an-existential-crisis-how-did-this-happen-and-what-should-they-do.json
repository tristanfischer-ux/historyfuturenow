They still get reliable electricity from the grid, with which to power their homes and businesses. Everything seems the same. Behind the scenes, however, the world is changing rapidly and electricity utilities - the centralised power companies that provide much of the electricity - and grid operators - the companies that transmit and distribute that centralised power - are reeling like battered boxers in round 9 of a heavyweight boxing championship. Some will make it. Others will be knocked out. In this article History Future Now explores why European utilities got into such trouble and looks to cellular evolution - specifically the endosymbiotic (\"endo\" = inside + \"sym\" = together + \"biotic\" = life) relationship of mitochondria inside a eukaryotic (\"eu\" = easily formed + \"karyo\" = nucleus or kernel) cell - to map out a path that some utilities might be able to take in order to survive. First, where are we now? Most big European electricity utilities are in deep trouble and their share prices have collapsed over the past 10 years. Some of the biggest players, such as EDF, RWE, E.ON, ENEL, Iberdrola, are trading at 90%-50% below their highs of a few years ago. A few, such as DONG and SSE are doing relatively well.
