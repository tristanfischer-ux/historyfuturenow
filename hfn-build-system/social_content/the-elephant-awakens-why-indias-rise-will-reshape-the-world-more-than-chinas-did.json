      "text": "India is not a new civilisation pretending to be a country. It is one of the oldest continuous civilisations on Earth, with a political history of recurring cycles of unity and fragmentation that offers both reassurance and warning.\n\nThe Maurya Empire under Ashoka (c. 268–232 BC) was the first to unify most of the subcontinent, extending from Afghanistan to Bengal. It was one of the largest empires in the ancient world, governing perhaps 50 million people at a time when the Roman Republic had not yet conquered the Mediterranean (Thapar, 2002). Ashoka's edicts, carved into rock pillars across the subcontinent, represent perhaps the earliest example of a ruler attempting to govern through moral persuasion rather than brute force alone.\n\nBut the Maurya Empire fragmented after Ashoka's death, as Indian empires tended to do. The Gupta Empire (c. 320–550 AD) — India's \"Golden Age\" of science, mathematics, and literature — followed the same pattern: brilliant consolidation, then gradual disintegration. The Mughal Empire (1526–1857) achieved the most extensive unification since Ashoka, at its peak under Aurangzeb governing roughly 150 million people and producing perhaps 25 per cent of global GDP (Maddison, 2007). But Mughal unity too was built on military conquest and administrative genius that could not survive the weakening of the centre.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/the-elephant-awakens-why-indias-rise-will-reshape-the-world-more-than-chinas-did\n\n#History #FutureOfWork #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
