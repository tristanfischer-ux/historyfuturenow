The brown territories were up for contention, with a leaning towards being slave states.  If the green territories became free states, and the brown territories were not allowed to become slave states, the number of free states would exceed the slave states, enabling anti slavery laws to be passed. This threat was the main driving force for southern secession and thus for the Civil War as the North tried to stop the South from seceding.\n\nIt is worth reminding ourselves that at this point in time the Republicans were the party of the North and the more populated areas, as the map below shows, and that Republicans were anti slavery and Democrats were generally pro slavery.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/roots-a-historical-understanding-of-climate-change-denial-creationism-and-slavery-1629-1775\n\n#History #FutureOfWork #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
