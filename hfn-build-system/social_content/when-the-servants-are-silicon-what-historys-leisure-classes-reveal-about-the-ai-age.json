Estimates vary, but most scholars place the number of slaves at between 80,000 and 100,000, against roughly 30,000 to 40,000 adult male citizens (Finley, 1980; Hansen, 1991). The ratio of unfree to free was somewhere between three-to-one and four-to-one. Slaves worked the silver mines at Laurion — a horrific existence, with life expectancies measured in months — farmed the land of Attica, staffed the households, manned the workshops, and performed nearly all of the manual labour that sustained the city's economy (Fisher, 1993).\n\nThe citizens, freed from the necessity of earning their bread by the sweat of their brows, did not lounge. That is the remarkable thing. Athenian citizenship was among the most demanding social contracts ever devised. Citizens were expected to serve on juries — the city empanelled 6,000 jurors each year, drawn by lot. They attended the Assembly on the Pnyx hill, where major decisions of war, peace, taxation, and law were debated and voted upon by any citizen who chose to attend. They held public office, trained for military service in the hoplite phalanx, and — crucially — *thought*. They philosophised, argued, competed in athletic and dramatic festivals, and engaged in the relentless, exhausting business of self-governance.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/when-the-servants-are-silicon-what-historys-leisure-classes-reveal-about-the-ai-age\n\n#Society #Demographics #Culture #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
