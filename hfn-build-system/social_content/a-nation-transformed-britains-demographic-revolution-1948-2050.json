In 1961, no question on ethnicity was asked; the population was routinely described as overwhelmingly white and British. By 1991, when an ethnic group question was first included in full, the White British share had already fallen. In 2001, the first census in which all residents could choose an ethnic category, 87.5% of the population of England and Wales identified as White British. By 2011 the figure was 80.5%. By 2021 it was 74.4% (ONS, *Census 2021: Ethnic group*, 2022). The trajectory is smooth and steep. There is no census after 2021 until 2031; the ONS has published survey-based ethnic group estimates for 2022–2023 (Annual Population Survey), but Census 2021 remains the definitive source. The ONS does not publish official projections of the population by ethnic group; any figures for 2050 or 2100 come from demographers applying census and birth data to fertility and migration assumptions, not from an official series. Geography explains a great deal. Migration did not scatter randomly. It followed jobs. Bradford and Leeds had textile mills that recruited from Mirpur; the Pakistani and Kashmiri population of Bradford is now one of the largest and most concentrated in Britain. Birmingham had foundries and engineering; its South Asian and Caribbean populations grew from the 1960s. Leicester received an influx of Ugandan Asians expelled by Idi Amin in 1972 and became a hub for Indian and East African Asian…\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/a-nation-transformed-britains-demographic-revolution-1948-2050\n\n#Society #Demographics #Culture #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
