Within every country there is variation: urban and rural, educated and traditional, young and old. A Tokyo financier and a farmer in Akita prefecture do not experience shame identically. A Swedish entrepreneur and a pensioner in Malmö may not feel guilt about the same things. What follows is a scholarly heuristic — the kind used routinely in cross-cultural management and international development — not a stamp on a passport. **Guilt-dominant societies** cluster in Western and Northern Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. The common thread is the inheritance of Christianity — particularly its emphasis on individual sin, conscience, confession, and atonement — reinforced by Enlightenment universalism and the legal traditions that followed. Nordic and Germanic Europe are the strongest examples: Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland consistently score highest on measures of rule of law, institutional trust, and (not coincidentally) Hofstede's individualism index (Hofstede, 2001; World Justice Project, *Rule of Law Index*, 2024).
