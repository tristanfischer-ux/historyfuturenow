Statistics which would suggest that over time the indigenous population – excluding immigration – will peak and then fall.  Japan’s population, at 128 million, has been falling by a few hundred thousand per year for the past 6 years.\n\nHistorically people bred for survival.  The institution of marriage, and a lack of birth control, meant that women had a lot of pregnancies.  Many pregnancies ended before their term, or resulted in stillbirths, or in high infant mortality.  Catherine of Aragon the first wife of King Henry VIII’s was cast aside for not bearing him a male heir in favour of Anne Boleyn.  Catherine actually bore him six children, including three sons, yet only Mary survived.\n\nThe natural philosophers of the 1700s, who morphed into the scientists of the 1800s, stopped believing in the four humours of black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood, (knowledge of which formed the core of western medicine from ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome) and brought scientific rigour and analytical statistics to providing a new understanding of why people got sick and died.  Basics of clean water and hygienic, clean equipment and spaces in surgery when conducting operations saved millions of people who would have otherwise died.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/lets-talk-about-sex-does-the-separation-of-pleasure-and-procreation-mean-the-end-of-people\n\n#Society #Demographics #Culture #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
