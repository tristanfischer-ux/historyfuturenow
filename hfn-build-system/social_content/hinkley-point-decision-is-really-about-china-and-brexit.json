Most of the UK’s major newspapers have come out against it and you can read their arguments on their websites:  see The Financial Times , The Telegraph , The Independent , and The Guardian .\n\nThe most positive thing that could be said about the decision was that is was made to prevent a negative: China threatened the UK with serious consequences if the project was scrapped.  The UK's ability to forge a free trade deal with China post Brexit is so important to the Brexiters' argument to leave the EU that anything that could jeopardise that from happening was deemed too great a risk for Prime Minister May.\n\nHistory Future Now is interested in the immediate controversy and, having spent 20 years in the energy sector, has a some observations on the merits of the project.  However, History Future Now is going to look at this in the context of a wider problem, which is why politicians and senior business leaders make decisions that are not in a country or society's long term interests.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/hinkley-point-decision-is-really-about-china-and-brexit\n\n#History #FutureOfWork #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
