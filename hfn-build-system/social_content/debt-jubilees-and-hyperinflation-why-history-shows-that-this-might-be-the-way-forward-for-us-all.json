      "text": "Government debt levels in the United States, the European Union and in Japan are at all time historic highs.  After decades of borrowing money to pay for regular annual expenditure and frequent military interventions the economies have been stretched too far by the collapse and subsequent bailouts needed to rescue the financial sector.  Working out what will happen next is a matter of great speculation, but history can provide us with some pointers about what could be done.  Two possible solutions are debt jubilees and hyper-inflation.\n\nMuch of the government debt accumulated over time will never be repaid and will be rolled over indefinitely.  However, interest on the debt does need to be repaid.  As governments become increasingly indebted, interest payments as a percentage of government expenditure will increase rapidly.  The US CBO expects that by 2025 US interest payments combined with the costs of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will be so large that they will theoretically consume 100% of all federal tax income receipts.\n\nClearly, this situation would make no sense and you could expect a general tax payer revolt long before this happened.  Citizens are highly unlikely to be willing to pay taxes if they got nothing in return: no schools, no roads, no hospitals, no national defense, no jails and no legal system.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/debt-jubilees-and-hyperinflation-why-history-shows-that-this-might-be-the-way-forward-for-us-all\n\n#Economy #FutureOfWork #Automation #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
