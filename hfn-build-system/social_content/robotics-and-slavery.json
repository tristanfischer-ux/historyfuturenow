We will begin by examining the current state of humanoid robotics and the key players driving innovation in this field, from Boston Dynamics to Tesla to NVIDIA and beyond.\n\nFrom there, we will look at the historical parallels between the rise of robots and the institution of slavery in ancient civilisations like Greece, Rome, and the Ottoman Empire. We will explore how the influx of slave labor transformed these societies, creating new forms of social stratification and economic inequality, and how the practice of individuals selling themselves into slavery to escape poverty or debt foreshadows the potential risks of widespread adoption of robots.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/robotics-and-slavery\n\n#Economy #FutureOfWork #Automation #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
