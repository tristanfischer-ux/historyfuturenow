Or that its aboriginal people speak a language that is Austronesian in origin, closer to what was spoken on Easter Island and Madagascar than across the 180 km stretch of water to Mainland China.\n\nToday, 98% of the population of Taiwan is Mandarin speaking Han Chinese.  Their government once was the government of Mainland China and claimed all of the country.  Today the reverse is true.   The Mainland Chinese People’s Republic of China sees Taiwan as a renegade province that will, eventually, be reunited with the rest of Mainland China.  They have stated that if Taiwan declares actual independence from Mainland China, China would keep it by force.\n\nThis is where things get really interesting.  The US sees Taiwan as a natural ally and China as an emerging rival.  In 1979 the US enacted the Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US would consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts of embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the region.  As a result, the US is a major arms supplier to Taiwan, providing it with the means to defend itself against an attack by China.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/why-china-could-invade-taiwan-and-get-away-with-it\n\n#History #FutureOfWork #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
