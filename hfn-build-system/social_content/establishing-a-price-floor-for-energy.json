If demand for the new iPad mini is strong, Apple will order its suppliers to produce more sub components, and its assemblers to assemble more devices, it will then ship them to eagerly awaiting customers.  Even for a company like Apple, however, there is a lag between demand and what they can supply: typically they will be planning new products 12-18 months ahead of their actual launch.  This is a real challenge for Apple’s management, who are trying to predict consumer demand for a new product. By the time of launch, other competitors could have released cheaper, superior products.\n\nIt is significantly harder in the energy industry, however, to effectively respond to pricing signals.  While consumer products have a 12-18 month development cycle, the energy sector moves at a snail’s pace and has a development cycle that lasts between 2 and 15 years.\n\nNew gas fired power stations can take 3-7 years to get planning permission and to secure financing.  Build times can take 12-24 months.  Large wind projects can take 2-5 years to get planning and financing and take 6-18 months to build. Nuclear power stations can take over 10 years to obtain planning consents, and 2-5 years to build.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/establishing-a-price-floor-for-energy\n\n#History #FutureOfWork #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
