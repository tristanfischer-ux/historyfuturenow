But beneath this conventional story lies a deeper and more complex tale - one shaped by the clash and synthesis of two very different cultural and spiritual traditions.\n\nOn one side stands the warrior ethos of the Proto-Indo-Europeans: a world of honor, glory and conquest, where warlike prowess and tribal loyalty reign supreme. On the other lies the radically different vision of Judeo-Christian monotheism, with its emphasis on humility, compassion, and the oneness of a sovereign creator God.\n\nThis History Future Now article presents a sweeping exploration of how these contrasting worldviews have competed and combined over centuries to mold the unique character of the West. We will trace their influence from the misty origins of pagan Europe through the rise of Christendom, the crucibles of the Reformation and Enlightenment, and the devastating conflicts of the 20th century.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/clash-of-titans-how-the-warrior-ethos-and-judeo-christian-monotheism-shaped-the-soul-of-the-west\n\n#Society #Demographics #Culture #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
