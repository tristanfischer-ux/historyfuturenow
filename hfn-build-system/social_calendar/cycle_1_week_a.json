      "text": "Much ink has been spilled about why Prime Minister May’s new Conservative government should not have approved the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station that is to be built by EDF, from France, with financial support from China. Most of the UK’s major newspapers have come out against it and you can read their arguments on their websites:  see The Financial Times , The Telegraph , The Independent , and The Guardian .\n\nThe most positive thing that could be said about the decision was that is was made to prevent a negative: China threatened the UK with serious consequences if the project was scrapped.  The UK's ability to forge a free trade deal with China post Brexit is so important to the Brexiters' argument to leave the EU that anything that could jeopardise that from happening was deemed too great a risk for Prime Minister May.\n\nHistory Future Now is interested in the immediate controversy and, having spent 20 years in the energy sector, has a some observations on the merits of the project.  However, History Future Now is going to look at this in the context of a wider problem, which is why politicians and senior business leaders make decisions that are not in a country or society's long term interests.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/hinkley-point-decision-is-really-about-china-and-brexit\n\n#History #FutureOfWork #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
