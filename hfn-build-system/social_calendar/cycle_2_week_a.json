      "text": "According to the OECD , China is due to overtake the US economy as the largest in the world in three years.  By 2030 it predicts that China will account for 25% of the world’s economy.  That is impressive.\n\nDetractors of this accomplishment will point out that the Chinese population is four times bigger than that of the US and so it is only reasonable that China should eventually have a larger economy.  If you look further back in history, when an economy’s size was directly linked to the size of its population, China and India both had larger economies than those of Europe and North America.  Industrialisation allowed for Britain, and then the US and other European nations, to produce far more than their populations had historically been able to do.  This brought economic, political and then military dominance.\n\nNow that China has also industrialised, on a spectacular scale, and Britain and the US are going through a process of de-industrialisation , it seems obvious that equal access to industrial technologies, plus a much larger population, will result in China being the dominant economic power in the world for the remainder of the 21st Century.  With this economic power you should expect political and then military dominance of the world.\n\nRead the full essay: https://www.historyfuturenow.com/articles/what-happens-when-china-becomes-the-largest-economy-in-the-world\n\n#History #FutureOfWork #HistoryFutureNow #LongRead",
