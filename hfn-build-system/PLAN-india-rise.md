## Core Thesis

The world spent thirty years watching China's rise and missed the more consequential story. India is now the world's most populous country, its fastest-growing major economy, and the only civilisational power with both a young population and a democratic tradition. China's rise was manufactured by the state; India's is organic, chaotic, and potentially more durable. Every previous shift in global power -- from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, from Europe to America -- followed demographic weight. The demographic weight is moving to South Asia.
